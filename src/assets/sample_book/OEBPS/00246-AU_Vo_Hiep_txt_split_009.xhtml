			<p class="firstpara"><span class="_idgendropcap">I</span>n the last year of junior high, I attended the same class as Thanh because she failed the junior diploma examination. My sister, Mai, attended eighth grade at the same school. Because of high school expansion, some classrooms had been taken away from the elementary school and annexed to the high school. Ironically, my classroom was the one that I had attended a few years ago with Mr. Mau, and in front of the classroom, there was the big tree where I had pushed Mui to the ground.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because of my mathematical skill, my mathematics teacher, Mr. Van, liked me very much. He always told other students in the school that they should learn mathematics the way I did. That, combined with my comedian role on stage, made me popular in the school.</p>
			<p class="indent">At that time, Mom returned from Saigon and started her new business that was a private English class at night. Dad converted the living room into a classroom for her. Mai and some friends of mine attended her class to upgrade their English. Because the English level she taught was lower than mine, I did not attend the class regularly but sometimes attended for dictation period to improve my vocabulary. Thanks to Mom’s business, our life improved a lot, and our English was better than others.</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, at school, when a class period was almost over, our teacher, Mr. T, unexpectedly asked Thanh’s group, “I don’t know if you still remember a schoolgirl named Binh or not?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thanh asked, “Teacher! Is she a pretty girl who was a former student in our class?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Some other girls, who were also in the same class with Thanh the previous year, said, “Oh, yeah! We remember her. We think she already passed the Junior Diploma last year.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The teacher replied proudly, “No, she failed. Yesterday evening, she came to see me and let me know that she would return here to attend our school again. Perhaps she would repeat the ninth grade.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I wondered to myself, <span class="italics1">Who is Binh?</span> Is she an important student, such that the teacher emphasized her in the class? Perhaps she is very beautiful, so that’s why he mentions her name. The teacher is also human, so he has the same feelings as other people. If he loves that girl, it is a natural thing.</p>
			<p class="indent">In my opinion, love should not be limited, unless that person does a wrong thing.</p>
			<p class="indent">One evening, about a week later, Mom said to me, when I was fetching drinking water, “This evening, we have a dictation. Do you want to attend my class?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “No, Mom. Tonight, I have a lot of homework to do after fetching water.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Really?”</p>
			<p class="indent">After finishing my duty, I went into the bedroom to study.</p>
			<p class="indent">Soon, Mom started her class in the living room.</p>
			<p class="indent">A moment later, when I was solving mathematics problems, I heard the voice of a gentleman from the classroom, “Hello, Teacher.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Then Mom replied, “Hello, Quang. You are late today.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Quang was a student of Mom’s. He was couple of years older than me. I did not know what he did for living; perhaps he was a businessman.</p>
			<p class="indent">I heard Quang answer, “Sorry, Teacher! Today, I brought a girl who wants to learn English with you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I heard a sweet voice say, “Good evening, Teacher.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought, <span class="italics1">What a sweet voice! Perhaps she is very beautiful.</span></p>
			<p class="indent">Mom said, “Hello. What is your name?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Quang answered instead. “Her name is Binh.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I wondered if that Binh and the Binh that Mr. T had mentioned in the class were the same. My curiosity urged me go out to see that girl, but I thought it was too rude. I had no reason to go out there to look at the girl that way. So I stayed in my place and studied my lesson.</p>
			<p class="indent">After one hour of grammar lessons, Mom told the class, “Now we have a dictation. Close your books and put them away.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought that it was a good chance for me to see that girl. I picked up a piece of paper and a pen for the dictation, then went out to the class.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mom was surprised by my casual attendance.</p>
			<p class="indent">She asked, “You’ve also come here for the dictation?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes, Mom.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Under the light of the neon, I suddenly saw a beautiful girl, who had on a long purple dress, sitting in the front row with my sister. I had a feeling that the class seemed to be brighter with her presence.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mom said to Binh, “Let me introduce my son to you. This is my son, Hiep.” She pointed to the girl and continued, “And this is a new student. Her name is Binh.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I bowed to her. She smiled and bowed back. What a smile!</p>
			<p class="indent">I could not concentrate on writing the dictation that day. I sometimes glanced at her to admire her beauty. Even though she did not wear makeup, she could not conceal her beauty. Her long black hair covered her shoulders and part of her back. Through the waves of her hair, I saw her straight nose and her long curved eyelashes under a pair of dark black willow-leafed eyebrows. Binh paid close attention in writing the dictation. She did not seem to notice anything or anyone else—including me.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the class was dismissed, I felt that I had lost something precious. One important thought came to me: I did not know if Quang was Binh’s lover or not.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">From then on, I longed for Mom’s next English class. I always hoped that I would see the fairy-purple-coated lady in the class again. Two days later, the next class met. I attended class right at the beginning, but Binh did not show up. I hoped that she would merely be late. Minute after minute elapsed and I still saw no sign of Binh. I tried to keep my cool and stay in the class until it was over, holding on to hope.</p>
			<p class="indent">I took Dad ’s bicycle and rode around town, hoping to see that beautiful girl somewhere. I spent an hour but could not see her anywhere. I ran across Nhung, my classmate, standing around a circus. Nhung was also a repeater of ninth grade, as Thanh was. I hoped he would know something about Binh.</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked him, “Nhung, last year you attended in the same class as Thanh, right?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes! So what’s up?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“So you likely know a girl whose name is Binh.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Sure! Two days ago, I met her walking along this street in a long purple dress with a young man, possibly her boyfriend. Do you know her?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “What time?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Evening. They went toward your house.” He frowned and repeated his question, “Is she your friend?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought, <span class="italics1">So they went to Mom’s English class.</span> I replied, “No! But…”</p>
			<p class="indent">Nhung burst into laughter, “Ha, ha! Hiep! Don’t be so stupid. About a dozen rich young men or high-ranking officers of our town were running after her. Don’t build your castle on a cloud.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I also knew that problem, but I could not resist my thoughts.</p>
			<p class="indent">I felt so sad and thought, <span class="italics1">Perhaps I’ve already fallen in love with that girl, but this is a unilateral love.</span> One thing was certain: the Binh in Mom’s class and the Binh that Mr. T mentioned were the same.</p>
			<p class="indent">Time went by. I could not find her anywhere.</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, we did not have a class first period. Suy asked me to go to school to play badminton. When we were playing, I saw a girl going to the registration office with an old man, possibly her father. Because of a hat that covered a part of her face, I could not recognize the girl. But by her gesture and profile, I guessed that it was Binh. If that were the truth, she would attend same class with me because my class was the only ninth grade class in the school that took English as second language.</p>
			<p class="indent">Suy served the badminton birdie, which hit my head. But I stood still, thinking without responding.</p>
			<p class="indent">Suy asked, “Hiep! What’s going on?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I awoke from my dream. “Nothing at all! I am thinking of something.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Then we kept playing, but I lost. Half an hour later, we had a physics period, so we had to go to our class.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">A week later, Hung, a friend of mine and also a student of Mom’s, came to my house and picked me up for school on his Velosolex, a mini motorcycle. Approaching our school, I saw many girls from my class were surrounding another girl at the back of the class, very close to my seat. I suddenly had a sensation that something weird was happening to my class.</p>
			<p class="indent">Soon, I noticed that the girl they surrounded was Binh. All of a sudden, Binh looked at me, then all the other girls also turned their heads to look at me while talking to each other. That made me very nervous and ashamed. I could not walk freely to my class. Many times, I had acted on stage, but I never got that feeling. My heart beat like a drum, and my blood ran quickly through my body. Possibly, Binh was checking with other girls about my status, to see if I was the son of the English teacher.</p>
			<p class="indent">Hung teased me. “Hiep, there is the beauty of your dream.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I dared not answer, only walked to my place.</p>
			<p class="indent">Soon, the civil rights teacher, Mr. Mo, arrived and the class started. Binh did not know where she should sit, so she stood at the door.</p>
			<p class="indent">The teacher introduced Binh to my class. Then he turned to Binh and said, “Binh, you can sit anywhere you want.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Binh looked around for a vacant place. My class was divided into two rows; the one on the left side was for girls and the one on the right was for boys. After a few seconds, she selected her seat, which was symmetrical with mine, respective to the centerline of the class.</p>
			<p class="indent">Binh was a decorous girl. She rarely talked to a boy. Many boys in other classes sometimes passed by my class and opened the window to admire her. Binh ignored all of those boys. Among those boys, there were two big guys, the bullies of the school. They formed a gang in the school. The main activity of the gang was to block and beat the gang members of other schools, especially from Saigon. Because of my fighting in previous years, many times they sent someone to persuade me to join them, but I refused. Several times in the past, I had fought to protect my friends or my prestige, but I did not want to use a large number of people to beat on someone weaker.</p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute18" src="image/Image1572_copy.png" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\Class ar.png"/></p>
			<p class="indent">Since the day Binh attended at the class, I dared not talk with her. There were many reasons I felt that way. Firstly, I became timid when standing close to her and forgot all of my thoughts. Secondly, she was too decorous, so I feared that when I asked her anything, she would turn her head away and not respond. In that case, I would bury myself to the ground. The third reason was that many bullies in the school wanted to flirt with her, and I did not want to get into a fight because of a girl. The final reason was that possibly Mr. T would also pursue her.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, during the break, while all the other students went to the front yard to play, I went out to the backyard to avoid the noise. I leaned on a column on the back veranda of the class, looking at the street. Unexpectedly, I heard a noise. Looking over, I saw Binh leaning on another column. When she saw me, Binh smiled. Her smile captured my soul and made me stand stone still in my place.</p>
			<p class="indent">Binh burst into laughter. “What are you doing, Hiep?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I did not know what to say. I think my face blushed with shame, which Binh could see.</p>
			<p class="indent">Binh said, “My friends told me that you are the best in the class, especially in mathematics and drawing.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I regained my composure and hesitantly said, “I don’t know. But I think I’m not too bad.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Binh said, “They told me that you drew the title of our class wall magazine hanging in front of the classroom. You also made a poem for that magazine. Is that right?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I spoke indistinctly, “Ye…ah!”</p>
			<p class="indent">She said, “I’m very bad in mathematics and physics. Can you help me?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought it was the luckiest thing for me. “Oh yeah! I’m very glad to help you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Can you help me now?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes! Sure!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Binh went back to her place, and I followed her there. She took out her mathematics book and showed me problems that she couldn’t solve. We stood next to each other, and I smelled the fragrance from her hair. A good feeling came to me, a feeling that I never had before. I showed her the way to solve those problems. The class resumed, my friends poured into the class, and they all saw us, standing side by side. I felt uneasy, then I went back to my seat.</p>
			<p class="indent">From then on, we talked to each other. However, I did not know if Binh was simply showing sympathy to me, a poor boy, or if she considered me as a regular friend.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the class, I sometimes leaned my face upon my right hand and glanced over to the other side. That way, I easily admired Binh. One day, when I glanced over Binh, suddenly I saw her black eyes looking at me. My heart beat like a drum at a rock concert. A few days later, Binh leaned her face upon her left hand to look at me. Every time that happened, we both smiled, a smile that contained many meanings. I felt very glad, but I did not know her smile’s meaning. My smile meant “I love you.” I hoped her smile contained the same meaning.</p>
			<p class="indent">A few weeks later, our teachers realized what was happening. They forbade everyone in the class from looking at each other that way when they were explaining the lessons. I know that they feared if we did, we would miss or misunderstand our lessons. The first teacher who applied that rule was Mr. Mo, then Mr. Han, the physics teacher, and then Mr. Van, the mathematics teacher, and so on. Mr. Han applied that rule strictly.</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, Mr. Han said, “From now on, if anyone in the class leans his or her face upon one hand, looking to other direction during my explanation, I will punish that one.”</p>
			<p class="indent">So I had to control myself by keeping from doing so during his class period.</p>
			<p class="indent">A long time later, I forgot that rule. One day, Mr. Han was explaining to the class about basic atomic theory. I accidentally leaned my face upon my hand again and glanced over at Binh’s place.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mr. Han looked at the book and said, “I reminded you about my rule.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I hurriedly put my arm down. The teacher continued to explain the lesson. I sometimes said something that made the entire class burst into laughter. I glanced over and saw Binh laughing merrily and glancing at me. I was so happy, and I forgot the rule.</p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute19" src="image/Image1580_copy.jpg" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\GLANCING.png"/></p>
			<p class="indent">Suddenly, Mr. Han dropped the chalk and angrily said to me, “Hiep! I’ve warned you many times about your ignoring my explanation. Today, I must punish you. Now, get up! Get out of the class!” He pointed to the big tree in front our classroom, then continued, “Stand by the trunk of the big tree over there! Now move!”</p>
			<p class="indent">I had to obey him by going there. Standing alone, I was very ashamed because many other students looked out and made faces to me. That tree gave me many things to remember; a couple years before, I had been punished because I pushed Mui by that tree.</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought I would have trouble with the coming physics test if I missed that lesson. Therefore, I concentrated on listening to what the teacher explained in class, even though I saw nothing.</p>
			<p class="indent">When there were only ten more minutes until the class was over, the teacher asked Ba Gà, the class leader, to call me in. I looked at some pictures on the chalkboard to piece together the teacher’s explanation.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mr. Han asked the class, “Is there anyone who can come here and re-explain the lesson one more time for the class?”</p>
			<p class="indent">This was the first time he had done that. I know Mr. Han loved me very much. I was one of his favorite students. Although he was punishing me, he did not want me to fail the next test, especially the Junior Diploma Examination, which would take place by the end of that school year.</p>
			<p class="indent">I knew he wanted somebody to re-explain the lesson so that I could have a chance to learn the new theory. That way, I would not fail the coming test.</p>
			<p class="indent">The whole class kept quiet. Everyone looked at each other.</p>
			<p class="indent">He said, “If anyone can do so, I will give him twenty points.”</p>
			<p class="indent">No one had a score that high before. But the class still kept quiet.</p>
			<p class="indent">The teacher seemed to lose his temper. He angrily scolded, “I spent a lot of time explaining the lesson, but where are your ears? You are foolish as cows!”</p>
			<p class="indent">I raised my hand, which surprised the whole class.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mr. Han looked at me and asked with astonishment, “Can you? You were at the tree out there. Do you know anything about this lesson?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I confidently answered, “Teacher, I can re-explain the lesson.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He said happily, “Okay! Come on up here!”</p>
			<p class="indent">I came to the chalkboard and explained the lesson just as he had.</p>
			<p class="indent">After school, Suy, Tieng, and I walked home together. At the gate, we saw Binh standing there alone.</p>
			<p class="indent">Suy and Tieng separated and went another direction.</p>
			<p class="indent">When I came closer to her, she stopped me and said, “Hiep, so far, many friends have told me about you, but today I witnessed how good you are. I am very proud to be your friend because of your intelligence.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I could not answer her. Part of me was thrilled, and another part was so nervous walking along the street with a beautiful girl, the girl whose image I had kept in my heart. It was a dream that I longed to have for a long time. I had a feeling that everyone on that street was looking at us. My legs could not walk as usual. They seemed to be tangled in invisible threads.</p>
			<p class="indent">After a moment of silence, I took all my courage to say, “I am very lucky to be your friend too because of your…your…”</p>
			<p class="indent">I was going to say “your beauty,” but I could not utter those words.</p>
			<p class="indent">She continued, “My friends told me many things about you. Today, I myself witnessed your actions that made me believe in their words.”</p>
			<p class="indent">We walked together about hundred meters, then I looked back and recognized Suy and Tieng following twenty meters behind. I wanted to talk with Binh a lot, but my mouth felt frozen.</p>
			<p class="indent">Finally, I said to her, “Binh, I must wait for my friends behind us. Sorry!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Binh did not reply. I stayed there to wait for Suy and Tieng, while Binh looked down to the street and kept walking alone. I felt bad and regretted that moment.</p>
			<p class="indent">When Suy and Tieng reached my place, Tieng insulted me. “Why didn’t you go with her? We don’t need you go with us.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Suy added, “So far, I thought you were brave. Now, I realize that you are only a coward.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I also realized that. Therefore, I did not answer them.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">One afternoon, when I was doing the gardening in front of my house, my sister ran out of the house and said, “Hiep, come over here! I want to show you this.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I washed my hands, then went to her and saw her holding a picture.</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “Whose picture is that?”</p>
			<p class="indent">She replied, “Mr. Th’s family.”</p>
			<p class="indent">We did not know him and his family but only heard my parents talking about them many times. Mr. Th, at that time, was a province chief of a province in the central part of Vietnam. Mr. Th was a close friend of Dad ’s when they worked together at Phan Thiet City Hall in 1937. After the revolution in 1945, they could not contact each other.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mai pointed to a sixteen-year-old girl in the picture and said, “You see that girl? She is pretty!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Looking at that, I said, “Yeah! She looks cool!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Let’s see…what’s her name?” Mai turned the picture over and read the back, then yelled, “Oh! Her name is Kim. I’ve heard that when our parents and Mr. Th’s family lived in Phan Thiet, they always said they would allow their children to marry each other. Therefore, when you meet Kim, you must talk friendly to conquer her heart, okay?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I did not reply, only smiled and thought, <span class="italics1">How can a province chief’s daughter love a poor person like me?</span></p>
			<p class="indent">Moreover, the image of Binh still dominated my heart.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">I missed Binh a lot, but I had no reason to go see her at her house. According to our culture at that time, love between male and female had to be concealed from the other, especially for teenagers. One thing I was sure was that, every Sunday at 10 a.m., Binh came home from church, which was located in front of our school.</p>
			<p class="indent">For that reason, at that specific time, I went to the intersection of Phan thanh Gian and Ly thuong Kiet Streets, close to her house, pretending to watch the Chinese chess game. But actually, I waited for Binh to come home from church. When we saw each other, we exchanged a smile. That was enough! That night, I would have a good sleep with a golden dream.</p>
			<p class="indent">Through newspapers, sometimes, there were many young people who loved each other but could not marry because of different religions. In our culture, the parents decide the marriage of a couple. Those couples could not live with each other during their lives, so they committed suicide to conserve their love.</p>
			<p class="indent">Binh and I were in the same boat with those couples. Binh’s family migrated from the North to the South, and her religion was Catholic. My family believed in Buddhism, but I did not totally believe in that. Any religion is good, if it teaches mankind to do the good and avoid the bad. I only use some basic theories of Buddhism to direct my life. I disagree with anyone who is too proud about his or her religion and looks down on others. When a young person falls in love, his or her parents always force the other to follow their religion. I do not think that is fair; they take advantage of love to oppress that person.</p>
			<p class="indent">I agree that each of us must have one religion to direct his or her life, but if one believes too much and is too proud about that, he or she would become a fanatic. When we are extremists, we would do everything for our religion, including killing other people who belong to another religion. For that reason, in our world history, there are many wars that killed millions of humans in the past thousand years. I feel we should consider all religions are equal, no one higher than the other, and we should respect the other religions.</p>
			<p class="indent">My mom’s side of the family is a good example for the younger generations to imitate. At the beginning of the twentieth century, my grandpa and my grandma loved each other. But one obstacle blocked their way: religion. My grandpa is a Catholic, while my grandma is a Buddhist. With the religious discrimination of my country at that time, their love would never come true. However, their parents on both sides were very liberal. They agreed on one point, ignored the religion, and allowed the young couple to celebrate the wedding, and they kept the same religion.</p>
			<p class="indent">Is this fair enough? Not yet. Moreover, their sons would go to church with the dad, and daughters would go to Pagoda with the mom. So my uncle is a Catholic, and Mom and my aunts are Buddhists.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the whole world follows that pattern, we won’t have religious war that cost millions of life.</p>
			<p class="indent">Binh’s family was as poor as mine. Her sister owned a small shop that sold wooden sabots. To reduce my lovesickness, many times at night, I planned to visit her at her house because I feared someone would recognize me in the daytime. When I arrived there, I just stood in front of her house for half an hour, even if it was hot, cold, or rainy, then I returned home. I dared not come in to see her. I always scolded myself: “Hiep, you are a stupid boy. Next time, you must show your courage by knocking on the door and coming in to see her.” But the next time, the stage showed the same play.</p>
			<p class="indent">One night, I asked Suy to go with me to the Front Beach to enjoy the sea breeze, but actually, I wanted to pass by Binh’s house. As we passed her house, I could not see her. We stayed at the beach for an hour, then returned home. On the way home, as we approached her house, I glanced over and saw her standing at the sabot shop.</p>
			<p class="indent">Unexpectedly, Suy said, “Teacher T is coming!”</p>
			<p class="indent">I turned back at the same time he was passing us on a bike.</p>
			<p class="indent">In accordance with our culture, Suy crossed his arms and bowed, “Teacher!”</p>
			<p class="indent">My right hand was still in my trouser pocket, so I could not cross my arms as the culture dictated. I only bowed and said, “Teacher!”</p>
			<p class="indent">A second later, we all heard <span class="italics1">kr-ee-ee-t</span>, the sound of his bike brake echoing at our backs.</p>
			<p class="indent">Suy said, “You’re in jeopardy!”</p>
			<p class="indent">I took my right hand out of my pocket. A second later, Mr. T stopped his bike next to me.</p>
			<p class="indent">We both crossed our arms and bowed. “Teacher!”</p>
			<p class="indent">He stared at me and said with a scolding manner, “Hiep! You saluted me that way?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I politely apologized, “I’m sorry, Teacher! Last time, I could not take my hand out of my pants pocket in time, so I could not cross my arms.”</p>
			<p class="indent1" id="calibre_pb_19">He looked at me for a few seconds, then said, “Hum!” and left there.</p>
