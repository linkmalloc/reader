			<p class="firstpara"><span class="_idgendropcap">H</span>alf a month later, ignoring the danger, my parents went to Cai Hang to preside at our engagement ceremony. The ceremony took place beautifully. Everyone seemed very happy, especially Diep and me.</p>
			<p class="indent">That night, we went to bed very late after a long time chatting. When we were sound asleep, suddenly something went off very loud, and bright lights sparkled. We knew the VC were using mortars to attack the local soldiers nearby. We rushed to a shelter trench, but it was too small for everyone, so only the women and children could hide in it; all the men had to sit outside. Luckily, there were no casualties, but Mom had a chance to feel the fear of war.</p>
			<p class="indent">According to the agreement of our parents, the marriage would be held at the end of that year instead of waiting for Diep to reach twenty years old. They all feared other mishaps like the one created by Captain Lan.</p>
			<p class="indent">As her fiancé, I frequently went to see Diep or took her out for sunset promenades or we visited some beautiful site.</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, I took Diep to a small canal for fishing. We sat side by side under the shade of a tree to chat and enjoy the breeze from the Mekong River coming in. Unexpectedly, we heard a scooter stop behind us. We looked back and saw Ngan, the high school principal. He descended from his scooter and approached us.</p>
			<p class="indent">He said, “Hello, Hiep. What are you doing?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Hello, Ngan. We are fishing.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He smiled. “Do want to be Khuong tu Nha?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Khuong Tu Nha was a legendary person in a Chinese history story. He used to go angling to wait for a good chance and a good time to become a mandarin.</p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “I don’t want to get involved with fame and money, so I need not wait for a good chance.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Really?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “What’s up, Ngan?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I want to talk with you about a problem.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“What’s that?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“A few years ago, you wrote a letter of recommendation to promote me to become the principal of this school.” He smiled and continued, “Now I am promoted to another higher position, the assistant chief of the education section of Vinh Long Province. Before leaving the current position, I want to ask you if you want to be principal or not. In case you are interested in that position, I will write a letter to recommend you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I answered, “Ngan, if I had wanted that position, I would not have requested the department to allow you to replace me. And today, perhaps they would promote me to the assistant chief of section. Nevertheless, I thank you for your good idea.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Ngan besought, “Would you please accept that position, Hiep?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I shook my head. “No, I don’t want that position.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“So if I suggest someone else, you won’t get angry, will you?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Sure! I’ll never get angry with that.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Ngan nodded. “I already predicted your answer, but anyway, I still had to ask you before promoting another.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Thank you, Ngan.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He smiled. “So enjoy your fishing. Goodbye.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Goodbye.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He started his scooter and drove away.</p>
			<p class="indent">A week later, Ngan wrote a letter of recommendation to the Education Department to promote Dinh Hoai Long, a physics teacher, to take over his position. Then Long selected Vo Van Mot, a biology teacher, to take Curriculum Section Head and Phan Ngoc Tho to become the Discipline Section head.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">August 23, 1972, the 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry of the US returned to America; it was the last combat unit to leave Vietnam. They completed Vietnamization, the program that US Defense Secretary Melvin Laird had unveiled in October 1969—the plan that shifted the heavy burden of the war to the South Vietnamese.</p>
			<p class="indent">Taking advantage of that and the negotiations in Paris, the VC from North Vietnam launched attacks at An Loc and Quang Tri. Our troops fought back successfully, defeating the VC at An Loc in June. At Quang Tri, the VC used the old strong fort, which was built by the Nguyen dynasty, to resist against our forces. In September of that year, our troops retook that city.</p>
			<p class="indent">By that time, like the Can Lao Party of President Diem, President Nguyen Van Thieu formed a political party named Dang Dan Chu (Democratic Party). He forced all public employees and soldiers to take part in that party. I myself did not want to be a member of the party because I did not think he was a good, clean leader. For that reason, I did not fill out the application form to register to be a member of the party.</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, I had to return to Saigon to teach at private school.</p>
			<p class="indent">As I returned to the school, Long, the new principal, stopped me at the office door and said, “Mr. Hiep, congratulations!”</p>
			<p class="indent">I was taken by surprise, not knowing what he meant, but Mot and Tho also came and circled around me.</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “What for, Long?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Long rubbed his hands. “The day before yesterday, all the teachers from elementary to high school of the district got together and voted you to be the general secretary of the Education Section of the Party of Cho Lach District.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “I still don’t understand. What party is it?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mot replied, “It is the Dang Dan Chu (Democratic) Party of President Thieu.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I frowned and said, “It’s so ridiculous! I am not a member and did not participate in the election meeting. Why did they elect me to that position?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Tho said, “There is nothing ridiculous. They voted you by absentee.”</p>
			<p class="indent">From that day on, I was summoned to go to the District Party meeting many times. I did not feel good attending those meetings, and many times, I asked to resign, but no one agreed to that.</p>
			<p class="indent">Soon, a national election for the lower level of government in districts and villages took place. The party held a meeting to discuss an appropriate measure in order to take as many seats as possible.</p>
			<p class="indent">One morning, when I was teaching, a person came to my class and handed me a telegram. I opened it and read:</p>
			<p class="indent">Public Telegraph.</p>
			<p class="indent">To Mr. Vo Hiep, General Secretary of Education Section of Democracy Party of Cho Lach District.</p>
			<p class="indent">To encourage and control voters of the district to support our Party’s candidates in the coming election, Democracy Party will hold a meeting to discuss that matter on…</p>
			<p class="right-align">Nguyen Van Y<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-013">76</a></span><br class="calibre4"/></span>Party Representative<br class="calibre4"/>Cho Lach (date)</p>
			<p class="indent">On that date, I went to the meeting. At the meeting, I recognized the Assistant Chief of Province, District Chief Major Le Thom, and many other officers. Thom had just been promoted to major.</p>
			<p class="indent">After the opening speech of District Chief Major Le Thom and the responding speech of the assistant chief of the province, we started discussing the measure. Firstly, they encouraged the members of the party to run for positions in the village of the district. In the second part of the meeting, they talked over the campaign procedures and how to eliminate their opponents.</p>
			<p class="indent">One person said, “To win the election, we should appoint someone to act as an undercover. They would secretly tear the opponents’ posters and banners apart.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The whole auditorium gave that person a big hand. Almost everyone did not want to show his or her opinion against the Party’s local leaders. They feared revenge, and this matter could very easily happen in our society. The best way to satisfy those leaders was to shut their mouths and clap their hands as loud as they could.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another said, “We should take part in the campaign of our opponents by asking them very tough questions that make them baffled. Then, many of our members in the crowd would jeer them and make them lose control.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The whole crowd applauded him again.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the next part of the meeting, we discussed how to control villagers and how to cope with Communist sabotage on Election Day.</p>
			<p class="indent">One person said, “That morning, we should deploy all our members and local soldiers everywhere to force villagers to go to the voting center to cast their vote. We also tell them that they should cast the ballots for our candidates.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Another added, “We can hand our candidate ballots to illustrate or give them to villagers at the voting centers…”</p>
			<p class="indent">All kinds of ideas to help the candidates of the Party would end with applause from the audience. They would then be recorded for future implementation.</p>
			<p class="indent">After more than an hour and a half of the meeting, the district chief said, “Before we have a break, does anyone have any opinion about our discussion or not?”</p>
			<p class="indent">The whole crowd remained silent.</p>
			<p class="indent">The assistant chief of the province added, “Any opinion from the audience?”</p>
			<p class="indent">The whole crowd still kept quiet. I raised my hand.</p>
			<p class="indent">Major Thom, the chief of district, asked, “Mr. Hiep, do you have an idea? Please speak out.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I stood up and said, “After hearing all the opinions, I have the feeling that we are applying Communist policies in the coming election. For a party with the name of Democracy, I don’t think that we should carry out those measures. Our country is a part of the free world. We stand side by side with other democratic countries to stand against Communist countries. How can we use a Communist strategy? It would harm the spirit of democracy. If we apply a measure similar to the Communist one, we can’t succeed in a political war with them.”</p>
			<p class="indent">When I finished, the crowd gave me a big hand. The assistant chief of the province leaned toward Major Thom to ask him something, and Major Thom looked at me while answering him. I knew they wanted to do something to me.</p>
			<p class="indent">Soon, break time came and then we went out of the auditorium to chat. All of a sudden, someone tapped on my shoulder. I looked back and recognized that it was the assistant chief of the district, Mr. Nguyen Van Y.</p>
			<p class="indent">Y said, “Mr. Hiep, would you please go to that corner with me?”</p>
			<p class="indent">He pulled me by my shirt to a remote place.</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “What’s the matter, Mr. Y?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mr. Y asked, “Who invited you to the meeting?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I pulled out the invitation card from my pocket and answered, “This is the card that you sent to me yourself last week.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He looked at the card, then said, “This is my fault. I don’t think you should attend this meeting. You can go home, sit back, and relax now.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I knew the assistant chief of province and the district chief wanted to drive me out of the meeting and asked Y to do so, but that was still much better than what the Communists would have done. If I had dared to speak out like that at a Communist meeting, they would jail or kill me right away.</p>
			<p class="indent">I smiled. “Thank you, I will go home. By the way, please remove my name from the party member list.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Y said, “All right, Teacher Hiep.”</p>
			<p class="indent">That day, I was expelled from the party, and it made me very happy.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">In April of 1972, President Nixon of the US went to visit China. It was the first time for an American president since the Communists drove Chiang Kai-shek out of the mainland. More importantly, the relationship between China and the US was considered very tense at that period.</p>
			<p class="indent">In May, Mr. Nixon once more astonished the world by visiting the USSR. Was this a game of Mr. Nixon toward the fake unity of the Communist world?</p>
			<p class="indent">After my engagement ceremony with Diep, Mr. Cuong was very happy because he thought he could take part in his beloved youngest daughter’s wedding. He saved 80,000 piasters to buy a cow for her wedding ceremony.</p>
			<p class="indent">Unfortunately for him, one day in May, a unit of local soldiers held a mopping-up operation searching for VC at his village. Mr. Cuong hurriedly hid his money underneath of a pile of coconut shells.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the soldiers got to his house, they asked him, “Where are you hiding your money?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mr. Cuong trembled. “I don’t have money, sirs.”</p>
			<p class="indent">One soldier trampled on his body, then beat him several times. “Where is your money?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I’m very poor. I don’t have any money at all.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He still did not declare where the money was, but his eyes looked at the coconut shell pile. A soldier came to that place, kicked the coconut shells, and found that money. Mr. Cuong jumped him and tried to take his money back. He begged, “Please give back my money!”</p>
			<p class="indent">The soldier pushed him to the ground, but he did not give up and jumped him one more time.</p>
			<p class="indent">He implored, “Mr. Soldiers! Please give my money back. It’s the money for my daughter’s wedding. I would be grateful, if you do so.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Another soldier kicked his body, making him fall to the ground, then they took the money away.</p>
			<p class="indent">After that event, Mr. Cuong was very sick. He sorrowed over the loss of his money, and he was also hurt by the beating.</p>
			<p class="indent">We learned that news on the occasion of Mid-Autumn Festival, exactly one year after the day I came to see him at Cai Hang. I borrowed a powerboat from Diep’s cousin to take Diep to Cu Lao Dai, a small island in the Co Chien River near Cai Hang, to take him back to Tan Thieng. I had no experience controlling a powerboat before, so it took me awhile to drive it at very low speed before I could break in to.</p>
			<p class="indent">When we reached Diep’s cousin’s house at Cu Lao Dai, we went to the house. With the help of her cousin, we took Mr. Cuong to the boat. I drove the boat back to Tan Thieng. Mr. Cuong, at that time, was in delirium. He lay motionless and sometimes murmured, “Give back my money! Give back my money, Mr. Soldiers!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Sitting on the boat, Diep cried all day long.</p>
			<p class="indent">At Tan Thieng, Diep’s brother Sau Truyen took care of him. But a few days later, we heard that Mr. Cuong had passed away. We were very mournful, especially Diep. She wept for many days.</p>
			<p class="indent">When we arrived at Tan Thieng, the first thing to do was to go see my father-in-law’s body. We were all surprised because his eyes were still open.</p>
			<p class="indent">I turned to my brothers-in-law and asked, “Why don’t you caress his face so he can close his eyes?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Sau Truyen said, “The whole family already did that, but his eyes cannot close.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Nam Thanh, Diep’s stepbrother, said, “If a person passed away but his wish never came true, he could not close his eyes.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought, <span class="italics1">Diep’s father had something that he could not carry out, so he could not close his eyes. Or he’s still thinking of Diep and fears no one will take care of her in the future. Possibly, he is still regretting that he cannot see Diep’s wedding.</span></p>
			<p class="indent">Bay Ke said, “Hiep, would you please try to close his eyes?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I agreed and went to the coffin, silently praying, “Father, if you still worry about Diep, I promise to take care of her for life. You should not worry about that. Let yourself enjoy heaven.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I raised my hand and caressed his eyes, and they closed easily.</p>
			<p class="indent">I did not see the equality in my country. Diep’s family was a victim of both Communists and Nationalists of the South. Many other thousands of families had the same conditions.</p>
			<p class="indent">Based on the propaganda document of the South, Communists carried out the Land Reform Movement from 1953 to 1956 that killed more than half a million people in North Vietnam. Most families in the North were dressed in mourning apparel. At that time, with the population of the North approximately 13 million, they had killed 4 percent of those.<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-012">77</a></span></span> Many of them had been killed after public trials, but the majority had died because of economic besiegement. What was the economic besiegement? It meant no one bought anything from a besieged family or sold anything to the family’s members. Death after a trail was less cruel than the death of economic besieges because the latter had suffered hunger that lasted for many days. More than half of those who died that way were children and old people.</p>
			<p class="indent">During the war against France from 1946 to 1954, Communists killed many people who did not support them, calling them traitors. When Communists sentenced someone as a traitor or CIA, that person had to be executed; there was no other solution.</p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute74" src="image/Image2067_copy.jpg" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\ON THE CO CHIEN RIVER.png"/></p>
			<p class="indent">But who was a traitor? During the war to regain independence from France, many people had been killed by that word. In Thanh Hoa, many landlords had been sentenced as traitors because they had drafted a map of irrigation dams, such as Van Thach, Thuong Hien, and Bai Thuong, and sent them to French forces. It was ridiculous; those dams had been built by French engineers, so they not only had those map locations but also had the structural details of those dams.</p>
			<p class="indent">With the war in South Vietnam, the word “traitor” seemed to apply to anyone. A person who did not cooperate in the agriculture tax or contacted the local government would be tied up with that dangerous word. If a family had a son joining the ARVN, the father would be sentenced as a traitor.</p>
			<p class="indent">What about the Nationalists? I prefer Nationalism to Communism, but a lot of people hid behind that word to do bad things to our people. I did not support anyone who made the country collapse by corruption, bribery, or smuggling—especially the ones who held our nation’s fate.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many very high-ranking officers indirectly helped the enemy in several ways. One of those was to take a portion of the US aid. There were many ways to do that; if they could not take dollars by building a bridge, a road, or a school, they would steal the military supplies.</p>
			<p class="indent">How could they steal dollars from the US aid?</p>
			<p class="indent">Suppose a group was assigned to build a bridge with a budget of $100,000. With that budget, the group would buy cement and steel to build five spans, but they needed only $70,000 to buy those. They put the other $30,000 in their pocket. For that reason, the bridge would be weaker in terms of stress or maybe it was enough to build only three spans. The two ends of the bridge would be built from earth and wood.</p>
			<p class="indent">How could they steal military supplies from US aid?</p>
			<p class="indent">There were a lot of ways to do this, but with one tactic, they could steal a whole truck in daylight.</p>
			<p class="indent">Suppose, there is a convoy of twenty trucks that carries the military aid from city A to city B. Of course, that convoy is escorted by MPs of the US forces. The thieves would use a similar truck as an ambush at an intersection. When the convoy approaches that intersection, one of the trucks of the convoy, almost at the end, would make a false alert and stop abruptly. When the MP car that leads the convoy is able to contact the last MP car, they are already a little bit apart. One truck of the convoy would turn out to a designated place while the empty truck would join the convoy to replace the real one. By that method, the organization could steal a whole truck.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sometimes, they got a truck full of razor blades or T-shirts or cigarettes. After selling them on the black market, they got millions of piasters. But other times, they got a truck full of guns or ammunition. In that case, they dumped the truck in a remote area. They had already helped the enemy because other units were lacking ammunition or guns.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many good, educated people wanted to help build up the country, but they did not participate in any party, so they could not carry out their plans. Not only that, they were sometimes put in jail. The other good guys had to cross their hands, watching the bad guys doing bad thing to our nation.</p>
			<p class="indent">During that period, we had a saying to depict the cleanest generals in our country: “Nhat Thang, nhi Thanh, tam Trinh, tu Truong.” That meant: “The first is Nguyen Duc Thang, the second is Nguyen Viet Thanh, the third is Phan Trong Trinh, and the fourth is Ngo Quang Truong.” However, they could not change our country’s fate because they were too clean, so they had no money to attract other people to support them. Eventually, the bad guys controlled the nation.</p>
			<p class="indent">Anyone who came to power did not want to release the power to others and became dictator. The president wanted to be a lifetime president by changing the constitution; no one could replace him, except by a coup d’etat.</p>
			<p class="indent">One general, after being appointed a chief of a strategy zone, made his first action to organize a party, dancing and celebrating for a few days. He did not ponder problems or try to find out how to get the people enough rice to eat.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fraudulent businessmen always bribed the authorities to hoard necessary materials. Others lent money at a very high rate. The rich became richer, and the poor became poorer. Where was the equality of society?</p>
			<p class="indent">Hundreds of thousands of privates and low-ranking soldiers with pay so that they could not feed their children had to fight to protect other highly positioned people or replace the demo soldiers or phantom soldiers. They saw their leaders doing bad things, and they had to do the same.</p>
			<p class="indent">As for the independence of the country, did this exist? Every important action of the nation had to be passed by the American government.<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-011">78</a></span></span> The fate of the nation—to take back the peace for our people—also depended on the talks of Mr. Kissinger, an American, and Mr. Le Duc Tho, a North Vietnamese. America decided when and where the South Vietnamese delegation could join the talks. When the US forces started pouring into Vietnam, I had a feeling that we would be in trouble because we could not control our country. The My Lai Massacre also made me sad. Although Communists were very cunning and they might disguise themselves as civilians, a mass killing like that, I could not accept.</p>
			<p class="indent">The North seemed to be more independent then the South, but their main policy had to follow the Soviet Union or China’s direction; they put the nation’s benefit behind the Communist Party’s.</p>
			<p class="indent">In fact, I had no ideals to follow. Should I support the Communists? No. Should I support the South Vietnamese government? No.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">One day in late September of that year, Diep’s mother led her to my house.</p>
			<p class="indent">She said, “Hiep, sooner or later, Diep will be your wife, but you know my family situation. It is very hard for me to take care of Diep. Can you replace her dad to take care of her?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I promptly said, “Mother, you are right. Diep is to be my wife, so I have a responsibility to take care of her.”</p>
			<p class="indent">She emotionally said, “If so, I’m very happy. We are very worried for her. When she misses us, please take her to Tan Thieng to see my family.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I proposed, “To make Diep more comfortable, I invite you to live with us. I think Tan Thieng is not a safe area, and with your presence in my house, she would be very happy.”</p>
			<p class="indent">She asked, “Can I live with you too?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I confirmed, “Yes, Mother.”</p>
			<p class="indent">To protect Diep more efficiently, at the beginning of the new school year, I made up my mind to quit all my classes in Saigon. Those schools started to list my name on the billboard to attract students. Only a few famous teachers had their names on the billboard like that.</p>
			<p class="indent">I taught at Cho Lach High School and operated a private class named Dong Tien Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry Center not too far from the high school (See Cho Lach map, page 231). I also accepted the invitation of a Catholic priest to teach mathematics at Thanh My Son, a private high school of the district with the median of Nguyen Tri Loc, a friend of mine. The school board had invited me many times before to teach there. However, I could not teach at that school because I was so busy with my schedule in Saigon.</p>
			<p class="indent">As with my previous private class, all children of deceased soldiers, poor students, monks, priests, or victims of war were allowed to attend these classes for free.</p>
			<p class="indent">I planned to stay in that district for a few years before transferring to Saigon or Vung Tau. In any case, we needed to have a house to live in. I designed a small house adjacent to the Center, and Diep helped me to build it. From then on, Diep and her mom lived with me there, and all of us enjoyed happiness.</p>
			<p class="indent">Next to my Center, there was a sixteen-year-old girl named Sau. Her family was at Binh Hoa Phuoc, a village sixteen kilometers from the district capital. Sau was not a nice-looking girl, and her family was very poor. However, she was a laborious student. She wanted to attend my private class, but she could not afford it. When I learned that, I called her to my house and let her know she could attend my class for free, as many poor students did.</p>
			<p class="indent">I taught mathematics for students from grade 8 up to grade 12, with each grade class population ranging from 80 to 100 students. For that reason, I asked Mai Chi Hieu and Luong Van Thai, my former students, to handle mathematics, physics, and chemistry from eighth grade to tenth grade, with very high pay.</p>
			<p class="indent">With that measure, I could help them to earn more money besides their salaries at public school. Hieu and Thai had been my students since 1967. They graduated junior high teacher training school at Can Tho. Then they all had been drafted to attend Military Academy at Thu Duc. After two years of military service, they were detached back to my school with the rank of chief warrant officer.</p>
			<p class="indent">At night, dozens of twelfth graders came to the center to study and help themselves. I allowed them to use the classroom chalk and electric light. They discussed things with each as other noisily as if they were at a little market. For that reason, my center was always merry from early morning until late evening.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, I had business in Saigon. After completing that business, I rode my Honda back to My Tho, then took a powerboat to Cho Lach as usual.</p>
			<p class="indent">Unfortunately, when I reached Ben Luc Bridge, my Honda broke down. I had to stop there to fix it, so I arrived in My Tho very late; there were no more powerboats going to Cho Lach. So I had to go to Be Tu’s house to sleep overnight. Be Tu was my former student at Cho Lach, and his house was at Tan Phong Village; at that time, he lodged at My Tho to attend a private school. He shared a wooden cantilever house on the My Tho River with some other students.</p>
			<p class="indent">Be Tu was very happy to see me. His attitude made his friends like me too.</p>
			<p class="indent">After dinner, I said, “If you guys have mathematics or physics problems that you cannot solve, take them out here and I will help you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">They all happily answered, “Yes, Teacher.”</p>
			<p class="indent">One asked me about an optical problem; others needed to solve electrical ones, and a few others asked me to re-explain space geometry theory. It took me more than two hours to do that job.</p>
			<p class="indent">At 9:30 p.m., Be Tu asked me, “Teacher, do you want to play billiards?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I realized that it would be boring if I did not have anything to do, so I replied, “Sure!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I’ll take you to Lac Hong to play. I think we should take a walk for exercise. But to get there soon, I will lead you to a shortcut. Do you like that, Teacher?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I nodded. “Okay.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He then went ahead; I followed him through dark, remote areas.</p>
			<p class="indent">Walking through a very dark area, I saw a deserted house. The house looked very good, with brick walls and a tile roof, but it seemed no one took care of the house, so it looked messy. I wondered why no one lived in that house at a time when we did not have enough houses for people.</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked Be Tu, “Why is that large house vacant?”</p>
			<p class="indent">He suddenly stepped back and held my arm. “Teacher, why…do you…ask…ask that story? It’s horrible!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“What is the horrible story?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Let’s get out of here, and I’ll tell you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">A few minutes later, we got to a bright area. I asked, “Now, can you tell me the horrible story of the brick house?”</p>
			<p class="indent">He narrated, “I was told that a few years ago, there was a young couple who lived happily in that brick house. One night, the husband suddenly woke up, took a knife, and stabbed his wife to death. He then embraced his wife’s body and walked in and out the house until the next morning. Finally, the police came, chained him, then put him in jail. Later, there was a story that the house is haunted.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I felt bad for the people in that story; the wife was dead and the husband was jailed. I said, “It’s too pitiful!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Be Tu suddenly put his hand on my mouth and said, “Teacher, don’t say that!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Surprised, I asked, “What’s going on?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“You should not say ‘pitiful.’”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Why is that important?”</p>
			<p class="indent">He explained, “In South Vietnam, when something bad happens to a young lady, a man never takes pity on that girl because the girl’s soul would follow the man forever, even taking him to hell to marry.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I laughed. “I don’t believe in ghosts. When I was young, I had to go to school at sunset and return home at midnight. I passed a few cemeteries, but I did not see any ghosts.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I’ve heard it from elderly people, but I don’t know if it’s true or not,” he said.</p>
			<p class="indent">We played billiards until after 11:00 in the evening, then returned home. When we approached the brick house, Be Tu held my arm firmly.</p>
			<p class="indent">I teased him, “It’s too pitiful!”</p>
			<p class="indent">He shouted, “Teacher, don’t say so!”</p>
			<p class="indent">When we got home, Be Tu told his friends the story. All of them agreed with Be Tu and advised that I should not say so.</p>
			<p class="indent">I felt tired and looked for a place to sleep. In the house, there was only one blank bed that could sleep two. Usually, that spare bed belonged to two other boys; in our culture, two boys could sleep in one bed and nothing would happen. That night, they yielded the bed for Be Tu and me.</p>
			<p class="indent">All the students of that house were preparing for the Baccalaureate-Part I, so they stayed up very late to study. I asked Be Tu to take a piece of material to cover a light that shone directly into my eyes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although they read their lessons softly, it was hard to sleep. One student read Vietnamese literature history of the eighteenth century; others read European history.</p>
			<p class="indent">Unexpectedly, my eyes closed, but I was still aware of my surroundings. I felt as if someone else had closed my eyes rather than doing it myself. I still heard those students reading. I got a bad feeling and tried to open my eyes to see the environment, but I could not.</p>
			<p class="indent">Suddenly, I felt someone put a cold hand on my abdomen. At first, I thought Be Tu was trying to tease me. I wanted to tell him to take his hand off my body, but I could not say a word. Just then, my body seemed to be frozen too, and a jittery feeling covered me.</p>
			<p class="indent">The cold hand moved slowly to my chest; at that moment, I realized it was a hand of a young lady. My whole body felt numb, and a current of cold ran from my nape through my backbone. The girl’s hand continued to move upward to my neck, then slowly squeezed my throat and made me suffocate. I wanted to call the students to help me, but my mouth was frozen too.</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought, <span class="italics1">Is it possible that the story Be Tu told me is real? I took pity on the girl’s family, and she thought I had sympathy for her. She wants me to follow her to hell. But she is only an invisible image, and I am a real person. Could a real person lose a contest with an invisible person?</span></p>
			<p class="indent">I tried to use all my strength to raise my hand to push the girl’s hand off my throat, but I still could not do it. Meanwhile, my lungs were out of oxygen. I thought I was going to die.</p>
			<p class="indent">I kept on thinking, <span class="italics1">Can I die this way? My fortitude will prevail over everything, and man must defeat ghost.</span></p>
			<p class="indent">Without a warning, my hand could move. I raised my right hand to hold her cold one turned inside out, while my left hand held her right arm and moved quickly to her elbow. During that movement, I recognized that her arm was as small as a twelve-year-old girl’s, cold as a piece of metal, and soft as rubber. I used an aikido move, and to finish, I used my strength to raise my left arm to push her elbow upward.</p>

			<p class="indent">All of sudden, I opened my eyes and realized that my arms and hands were in their right position but holding nothing. The students’ voices still echoed softly.</p>
			<p class="indent">One of them asked, “Are you still up, Teacher?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes, what time is it?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“One a.m., Teacher.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“How did you know I was still up?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I heard you moving.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I told them, “I felt a young lady squeezing my neck.”</p>
			<p class="indent">All of them ran from all directions to my bed, got into the mosquito net, and stayed up until the next morning.</p>
