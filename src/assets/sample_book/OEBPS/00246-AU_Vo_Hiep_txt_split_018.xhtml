			<p class="firstpara"><span class="_idgendropcap">T</span>he afternoon of that day, my cousin, Mr. Dinh Cong Hieu, a major in the air force, gave me a ride on a Cessna L-19 Bird Dog to Vinh Long because that was the day that he had to fly for retraining. </p>
			<p class="indent">When the plan was at high elevation, I could see our rural countryside. At this height, I saw the green paddy field with giant holes, which were made by bombs. I asked myself, “How many persons already lost their lives in this war?”</p>
			<p class="indent">The airplane touched down at Vinh Long Airfield at 4:00 p.m. after one hour of flying. I carried my luggage to the street and looked for a towed motorbike to go to the Cho Lach bus station beyond the Thieng Duc Bridge. </p>
			<p class="indent">There, I saw an old bus, Hoa Nam, parked to wait for customers coming. That was the last bus to leave there for Cho Lach.</p>
			<p class="indent">I felt lonely, then went to the street side and looked at the trees of an orchard nearby with a sorrowful feeling.</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked myself, “What is Cho Lach? How are the people of that district? Will they treat me good or bad? Where should I stay over tonight?”</p>
			<p class="indent">All of a sudden, someone asked me from behind, “Are you going to Cho Lach?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Turning back, I saw a young man, about twenty years old, with dark skin, a medium build, and an honest face, looking at me. I guessed he was a person of that district who realized I was a stranger and asked me that question.</p>
			<p class="indent">I bowed to salute him and said, “Hi there! Yes, I want to go to Cho Lach. And are you a native of that district?”</p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute43" src="image/Image1795_copy.jpg" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\GOING TO ASSIGNED SCHOOL.png"/></p>
			<p class="indent">He said, “Yes, Cho Lach is my native village.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “What time does this car leave here?”</p>
			<p class="indent">He looked at his wristwatch and said, “Only a few minutes from now.” Turning to me, he asked, “Mister, what is your name?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“My name is Hiep,” I answered, then I asked, “What is yours?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“My name is Linh.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked him, “What do you do for a living?”</p>
			<p class="indent">He smiled. “I’m a soldier, a sergeant, actually. Today, I have some days off, so I’ve returned home to visit my family. And you?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I’m a teacher. Tomorrow is my first day at that school.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He said, “Oh! You are a teacher.” Seconds later, he asked, “What kind of school are you going to teach?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Senior high.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“What subject are you teaching?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I teach mathematics.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Suddenly, Linh yelled with joy, “It’s cool! My cousins and my friends are waiting for a mathematics teacher for a few years. This year, they had to take baccalaureate with a mathematics major. If they have no mathematics teacher, they would be in big trouble. Teacher! Tonight, do you have any place to sleep overnight?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I felt uneasy because Linh suddenly called me, “Teacher.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “Don’t call me teacher. I haven’t taught you a day.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh shook his head. “No! You are a teacher so I must call you that. Moreover, my friends are your students. Why don’t you answer my question?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “Tonight? No, I don’t.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“So you come to my house to stay overnight, Teacher.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I reluctantly said, “I fear I would bother you and your family.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh laughed. “Bother me? Never mind, Teacher! Come on! Go with me. Tomorrow, many students will come to see you and they will make a party to welcome you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought, <span class="italics1">The Cho Lach people are very kind and hospitable.</span></p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “That’s fine! I will go to your house.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Some people got on the bus.</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh said, “Teacher, it is time to go now! Let me give you a hand.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He did not wait for my response; he picked up one of my bags and went to the bus. He yielded for me to get on the bus, then followed, sitting next to me.</p>
			<p class="indent">The old bus started to move slowly for three kilometers, then stopped at the riverbank of the vast Co Chien River, waiting for a ferry. Co Chien is a tributary of the Mekong River. So far, I just learned it from geography; now, I can see how big it is. Because of the previous storm, the river was covered with high white waves. In the middle of the river, a ferry moved slowly, lazily, up and down toward us like an old water buffalo dragging a plow when hungry at dusk. </p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute44" src="image/Image1802.png" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\CO CHIEN FERRY LANDING.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="indent">The landing bridge was a huge concrete structure, hollow inside, so it floated on the water’s surface. At the middle of structure was a plus-sign turning wooden table. Underneath, there were many rollers that rolled on a metal rail.</p>
			<p class="indent">After a while, when the ferry came closer and closer, I realized that it was a very old and small ferry. Perhaps France brought the ferry to that area at the time the Bao Dai Emperor was still a prince. </p>
			<p class="indent">When the ferry stopped, people went down first, then the bus followed. </p>
			<p class="indent">The bus could not turn because its turn table was narrow. It just pulled forward and stopped at the middle. </p>
			<p class="indent">A couple servicemen pushed the table, rotating 90°, and the bus pointed to the connecting bridge. They stopped pushing, and the bus went up the riverbank. I admired the engineering design.</p>
			<p class="indent">Now our turn, people went down, then bikes, and then the bus.</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh led me to the bow of the ferry to admire the beauty of the sunset. The river was very large, so the breeze blowing gently made us cool and created small waves lapping at the ferry. At the west side, the skyline of Vinh Long City stood out of the red, orange, and yellow sky. I suddenly felt homesick. I thought, <span class="italics1">At this time, Mom, Dad, and my brother are sitting around the table for dinner.</span></p>
			<p class="indent">Linh’s voice woke me up from my dream. “The first village that we will arrive at is Binh Hoa Phuoc; the next one is Phu Phung, and following that is Vinh Binh. Finally, we will arrive at Cho Lach.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Is this far from here?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“It’s about seventeen kilometers, Teacher, but it takes one hour to get there because the bus has to stop many places for customers to get on and off. Moreover, the road is not good.”</p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute45" src="image/Image1809.png" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\CO CHIEN RIVER AND THE FERRY.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “The road is not good?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh smiled. “Yes, sir, the road is merely made of earth and stones.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The darkness was falling as we arrived at the other side of Co Chien River.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sitting on the bus, I realized that Linh’s words were true. The road was very bad and gave me the feeling of riding on an oxen cart. When we arrived at Phu Phung Village, the night already closed down. The yellow oil lamps of some shops on both sides of the street reminded me that I really bade farewell to the prosperous city and returned to the simple life of the rural country.</p>
			<p class="indent">In accordance with Linh’s prediction, one hour later, the bus stopped at the riverbank of a small river, about fifty meters wide. The street was very dark; the light from oil lamps of houses around us could not help us at all. On the other side of the river, I saw several electric lights, a symbol of civilization.</p>
			<p class="indent">I realized that the road ended at the river and asked Linh, “Can cars go to other side of this river, Linh?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes, Teacher. We don’t have a bridge, but we do have a small ferry to carry cars across. Right here is the ferry landing.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh led me as we walked on an earthen road running along the river. The road was wet and slippery because of a thunderstorm that afternoon.</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “Linh! Why do the houses on the other side have electric light?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh answered, “That is the district office or District Headquarters, Teacher. The district chief and his men live in those houses.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“What is the name of this river?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“This is the Cho Lach Canal, teacher. The cement bridge in front of us is the Cai Ot Bridge. About a hundred meters more is my home. My sister is a midwife, and her house is also the birth clinic.”</p>
			<p class="indent">We crossed the Cai Ot Bridge, which connects a smaller canal. Soon, Linh stopped at a house with wooden walls, tin roof, and tile floor. The house was pretty neat.</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh raised his voice and called, “Nam! We have a visitor!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Inside the house, some people yelled with joy, “Linh’s returning! Linh’s returning!”</p>
			<p class="indent">A group of people ran from the kitchen to the living room with oil lamps in their hands. They were merrily asking Linh many questions. Linh stepped aside, so they saw me behind him, then they kept quiet, looking at me.</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh introduced me. “This is Teacher Hiep. He will teach mathematics at high school over here. And this is my older sister Nam,<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-055-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-055">34</a></span></span> the Midwife. Actually, her name is Nam only, but she is a midwife, so the whole district calls her Nam the Midwife, Teacher.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The midwife bowed to salute me. I bowed in return. Linh’s sister was about twenty-five years old, with a sincere face.</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh pointed to a young lady standing behind the midwife and said, “This is My Linh, your future student.” He paused, then said, “My Linh! Why don’t you show up to salute your teacher? A few days from now, he will teach you. If you do something bad, he will give you two zeroes as big as duck’s eggs.”</p>
			<p class="indent">My Linh went out to the light, smiled, bowed, then said, “Teacher, how are you?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Thank you, I’m fine.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Under the dim light of oil lamps, I realized that My Linh was very pretty and about eighteen years old. In Saigon, I rarely saw a girl like that.</p>
			<p class="indent">I saw another little girl hiding behind Nam’s back. I asked, “How about that little girl?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh pointed to the girl and said, “That is my younger sister. Her name is Hong, Teacher.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Nam and My Linh went to the kitchen; Linh led me to the veranda in front of the house to chat.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sitting on a wooden chair, I looked to the other side of the river; everything was in a giant dark blanket. Some dim yellow kerosene lights flickered behind a bamboo hedge on the riverbank and reflected on the river’s surface. Around us, the chirping of crickets mixed with the sound of leaves trembling in the wind; some fireflies flew back and forth. I suddenly gave a sigh; I really missed my family.</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh asked, “Teacher, how do you feel about the district?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“It seems to be sorrowful.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I hope you will get used to this.” He smiled then continued, “Tomorrow, many students will come to see you. At that time, you will be happier.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I sighed. “I hope so.”</p>
			<p class="indent">About one hour later, My Linh came out and said, “Teacher and Linh, please come in for chicken soup.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I felt very uneasy because that was the first time I met them, and they slaughtered a chicken for my dinner, so I stood still.</p>
			<p class="indent">Linh invited, “Teacher! Come on in for hot soup! If it is cold, it will not taste good. This time, you cannot eat out because there is no restaurant open.”</p>
			<p class="indent">With Linh’s natural attitude, I felt good and followed him to the kitchen.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">The next day, I went to Cho Lach High School to show my assigned document to the principal.</p>
			<p class="indent">The school was a small old complex including three single-story buildings arranged in a U shape with a playground at the middle. The playground was not a place to play because high grasses and weeds grew all over the place, especially at several tiny hills scattered over it. On the playground, I saw a few cows grazing; that gave me the feeling that this was a farm, rather than a school. Scattered on the playground, there were a few small ponds.</p>
			<p class="indent">Walking through a cement gate, I stepped onto a three-meter-wide brick way that divided the playground into two parts. The way was very old, with broken brick mixed with earth; some places were lower than the playground. Rainwater was caught at those places, so I had to go on tiptoe to prevent my socks from getting wet. That was the main way for the entire school. There were two small cement roads leading to two other buildings. Those small roads’ condition was much better than the main one. In front of the principal’s office, there was a nearly round flower bed with a skewed flagpole.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the office, fifty meters away from the gate, I met Nguyen Thanh Thuong, the principal. The principal was the French language teacher for the junior high and was about thirty years old. His native town was Can Tho, the 4th Military Zone capital,<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-054-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-054">35</a></span></span> about fifty kilometers from my new district.</p>
			<p class="indent">Thuong read the paper that I brought from the Education Department.</p>
			<p class="indent">After reading, he laughed. “Oh my goodness! I have a mathematics teacher now!”</p>
			<p class="indent">He looked at me and said, “For the few past years, I’ve requested a mathematics teacher. But as you know, every year, only a few mathematics teachers graduate from the whole nation, so no one goes to my tiny school. We are at drought, and you are the man to bring rain to us. All the eleventh graders will be so happy with this news.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “What grade should I teach, Mr. Thuong?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Our school has two eleventh grade classes that students need to take the Baccalaureate-Part I, and a few ninth grade classes that they need to take for Junior High Diploma. We don’t have a physics teacher, so would you please teach those classes, both mathematics and physics? Is that all right?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I nodded, then asked, “I have a letter to Miss Nguyen Thi Cuc, a student. Do you know her house?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thuong said, “Tomorrow, all the students will be here. I will call her to see you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">That evening, a dozen male students came to Nam the Midwife’s house, including Gan<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-053-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-053">36</a></span></span>, Dau, Tu, Thao, Minh, Chanh, and Tung. One took along a bottle of rice alcohol<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-052-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-052">37</a></span></span>, another brought a chicken. They held a party to celebrate my first day at school. They were very glad to have a mathematics teacher who graduated from university because there was no mathematics teacher at the school teaching the main subject for their coming baccalaureate examinations. Besides that, physics also a major subject they needed to learn.</p>
