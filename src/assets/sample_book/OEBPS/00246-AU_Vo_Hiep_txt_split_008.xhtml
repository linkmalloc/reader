			<p class="firstpara"><span class="_idgendropcap">T</span>hat year, a new school activity was introduced to the students. Students were encouraged to participate in one club in the arts and letters section of the class. Thanh and my sister have good voices, so they joined the chorus and dancing club. Thien is a good guitar player, so he joined the musical instrument club. I don’t have a good voice, nor can I play a musical instrument, so I didn’t participate in any group. In my class, I always made everyone laugh, so all my friends asked me to join the acting club as a comedian. I guess I did a good job because audiences always applauded when I showed up.</p>
			<p class="indent">On September of 1957, Mom went to Saigon to learn English in order to get a better job as English teacher for beginners to help Dad. Because all three of us were so busy with our lessons at school, Dad decided to take lunch at Thanh’s house. Her father, Mr. Tam, hired someone to take care of her house. Every month, we paid a sum of money to her family, and they prepared lunch for us. We prepared the dinner ourselves.</p>
			<p class="indent">At school, we had no more trouble with discrimination, but we still suffered it in our regular life.</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, when I was on the way to school, I ran across Duc Cong, who was running to school with bloody nose.</p>
			<p class="indent">I helped him to stop the bleeding, then asked him, “What’s wrong, Duc?”</p>
			<p class="indent">He answered painfully, “I’ve just met harelipped Mui. He was going to cut grass for his horses. When he saw me, he called my name and said, ‘Duc Cong eats a heap of dung.’ I retaliated by saying he is a dummy. He got angry and chased me. He caught me at the corner of the troop-child school and he beat me up. Hiep, when you see him, take revenge for me please.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I replied, “No, we are growing up now. Violence is not a good measure to resolve a problem. If I meet him, I will ask him to stop his violence, but you should not talk like that.”</p>
			<p class="indent">After a few years of living in South Vietnam and learning the ideals of freedom, my political opinions had changed greatly. I started to realize that in South Vietnam, we had more liberties than in the North. In South Vietnam, there was more than one political party, while in the North, there is only one, even though it was imperfect freedom. Life in North Vietnam was very harsh, and in the South, life was much better.</p>
			<p class="indent">Moreover, the theory of Communism varied from the fact. Communism is an interesting theory, but it is unrealistic. Communists base their theory on the book <span class="italics1">The Communist Manifesto</span> written by two German philosophers, Karl Marx and Fredrick Engels, to convert society.</p>
			<p class="indent">According to Communism, the basis of capitalism is to exploit. For example, a shop owner or a landlord hires ten people to work for him. By the end of that year, he exploits each person for $100 of work, so he already exploits from his employees $1,000 in all. He uses 10 percent of that amount, or $100, to buy two more machines or two more acres of land, and hires two more people to work in his shop or on his farm.</p>
			<p class="indent">The next year, that person can exploit 12 people, and of course, he could have $1,200 by his employees’ sweat. And he can buy more machines and so on. After a long time, he could exploit a thousand people, so he becomes richer and richer.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the basic theory of Communism, a Communist government will make sure every citizen has an equal life. To reach that level, they must destroy the rich and take their properties for the others. After that, all industrial laborers must share the right to control the factory and benefits. All peasants who live in the rural countryside must work on a public farm and have an equal portion of the living.</p>
			<p class="indent">A banner of Communism is “Work based on ability, benefit based on the need.”</p>
			<p class="indent">What does that mean? Work based on ability means a strong person works more than a weak one does, and the strong person must eat more than the weak one does.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is a marvelous theory! But the weak one has children, and the strong one is single. How do we solve that problem?</p>
			<p class="indent">Assuming Communists succeed in their policy, they could force people in the rural countryside to live and work together in a farm camp. In the camp, everybody has a different personality. In China, they have a saying: “Bách nhân, bách tính-<span class="ms-gothic">百人百性</span>” (A hundred people have a hundred personalities). Many people are hardworking people, and some others are lazy.</p>
			<p class="indent">Suppose two single people work at the same farm: one is weak but hardworking, and the other is big and strong but lazy. Every day, they have to go to the field to work. The hardworking ones work all day long, while the lazy ones always sit in the shade, chatting. Upon returning home, the strong guy eats more than the weak one because they cannot carry out “work based on ability, benefit based on need.” It is another matter that needs to be resolved. It is totally unfair.</p>
			<p class="indent">For one day or two days, that is acceptable, but for months and years, the hardworking people start to speculate. They think, <span class="italics1">I work too hard, and that guy only plays all day long, but he shares the same food portion as me. Why do I need to work that hard? I must enjoy my life.</span> For that reason, the hardworking ones begin to be lazy. The consequence is that there is no production, and no production means less food to eat, so everyone in all the public farm camps will be starving, and the whole nation will become poor.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another theory of Communism is “The Gioi Dai Dong,” meaning “no nation boundary” or “global single nation.” According to that, when mankind reaches its highest level, after implementing the Communist society, the whole world will become a single country. No boundary will divide one nation from another. I do not think that could become real. For thousands of years, the world always has wars over boundaries. Even animals want to have their own area. Fish have caves, and if they see other fish coming by, they always come out to scare the others away. A small dog lives in his house. If he sees another bigger dog passing his house, he always barks to protect his house, even though he is smaller and weaker than the other.</p>
			<p class="indent">Assuming the whole world becomes a single country, who would be the leader? A Russian or a Chinese? Vietnamese Communist members already divide into two groups: one has Soviet favor and the other has Chinese favor. So how can the world unite? If a Soviet becomes the leader, the Chinese would think of a way to overthrow that leader. Eventually, Communists fight against Communists.</p>
			<p class="indent">During the civil rights period, we usually discussed Communism and freedom ideals. I pointed out the bad things under the Communist regime, such as the propaganda that instilled loyalty to Uncle Ho and the Labor party people, especially the children. I also told my friends about the brutal Land Reform Movement.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many friends of mine still believed that Communism was much better than the South’s government, at least in the concept of independence. In terms of independence, I agreed that North Vietnam is better than South but not complete as an independent nation. I let them know that people in North Vietnam had to sing songs praising the Soviet Union and China. Students had to learn the history of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. During national holidays or important meetings, they had to sing the national anthems of the Soviet Union and China, in addition to the Vietnamese one. Truong Chinh took a pattern from China to carry out the Land Reform Movement and kill thousands of people.<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-081-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-081">8</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="indent">Those were the things we could see, important issues that related to our nation’s fate. Did the North Vietnamese government act alone, or did they have to obey orders from Moscow? Obviously, they put the Communist interest above the national one. Meanwhile, in the South, we did not need to know the national anthem of the United States; no one knew “La Marseillaise,” the National Anthem of France.</p>
			<p class="indent">Ironically, Suy and I were the best of friends, but we always collided in the political field because he inclined too much toward Communism.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">On the occasion of the Lunar New Year, “Tet,” my parents and their friends gave each of us money as a tradition. After three days of Tet, I collected more than 100 Vietnamese piasters. That was the first time in my life that I had so much money. Although that was not a big sum of money to other people, it was a big deal for me.</p>
			<p class="indent">I planned out how to use that money. First, I would use 20 piasters to buy some toy for me, maybe a small pair of binoculars, when I had a chance to go to Saigon. Secondly, 30 piasters would be used to eat North Vietnamese beef soup with my close friends, Duc and Suy. That would cost me five piasters each time. The rest would be used to buy some new clothes.</p>
			<p class="indent">I put the precious money in a box and stored it in my closet. To conceal my treasure, I put the money box under my underwear. Once a week, I took the money out to count it and took some piasters out to spend.</p>
			<p class="indent">A few months later, on the occasion of the Eastern holidays, Mom returned home from Saigon. The next morning, my parents led three of us to a restaurant to eat pho, the North Vietnamese beef soup. After opening her mirrored wardrobe, Mom could not find her money.</p>
			<p class="indent">She asked Dad, “Where did you put the change every day, honey?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Standing at the door, Dad replied, “In the money box, as usual.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Why can’t I find it?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Dad went back to the closet, saying, “Let me see!”</p>
			<p class="indent">He looked around for a moment, “What the hell is this? Every day, I put it over here.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mom said, “Are you sure?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes!”</p>
			<p class="indent">She asked, “Is the closet locked every day?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“No! Some days I lock it, and others I don’t.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mom looked at me. “Is there anyone in our family stealing Dad’s money?”</p>
			<p class="indent">All of us replied simultaneously, “No, Mom.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Dad said, “Okay. Let’s go! I have some money here. From now on, we should lock this wardrobe.”</p>
			<p class="indent">At the restaurant, my parents reminded us that the thief had to be punished. While saying that, they always looked at me. Although they did not mention anybody in particular, I knew they were suggesting that I was the thief. In our family, Mai was a timid girl, and Thang was too young to do that, so the only one in the family who would dare to steal that money was me. There were many reasons that they thought I was the thief. Firstly, I was tall enough to reach to the box. Secondly, I knew how to spend money. Thirdly, I was a tough boy, unafraid of a flogging.</p>
			<p class="indent">I felt very bad, but I could not prove that I was innocent. I always strove to find a way to prove that somebody else had stolen my parents’ money.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some days later, I took my own money box out to take some money to buy a comic book. I was surprised because my money was down by about 10 piasters. I thought that the last time I had taken out too much, but I couldn’t remember. In order to keep from making that mistake again, I counted my money many times. The next day, I took my money out to count and saw nothing wrong. I kept counting my money for a week, but it did not change, so I thought I must have just made a mistake last time.</p>
			<p class="indent">During those days, Thanh was the one person who could see my trouble every time I went to her house for lunch.</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, she asked me, “Hiep, why you are not as humorous as usual?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I sadly told her the story of losing money and how everyone in the family always thought I was the prime suspect.</p>
			<p class="indent">Thanh consoled me, “If you did not steal your parents’ money, you should not worry about that.”</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">The next month, Mom returned to Vung Tau to see us again. That was the last day Mom stayed at home; the next day, she would go back to Saigon to attend her English class.</p>
			<p class="indent">That day, at noon, when Thang and I were playing in front of the house, I heard Mom calling from the kitchen, “Hiep! Come in here!”</p>
			<p class="indent">I ran into the kitchen and saw Mom standing by the built-in water container.</p>
			<p class="indent">Seeing me, she angrily said, “The next time you climb to the roof with your dirty feet, I will flog you. Do you understand?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I replied, “No, Mom. I’ve never climbed to the roof with my dirty feet.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Shut up! Look at that!” She pointed to a footprint on the wall and continued, “Your footprints are still there. If not yours, then is it a dog’s footprint? Don’t deny it!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Looking at the footprint, I realized that it was the same size as mine. Therefore, I had to keep my mouth shut.</p>
			<p class="indent">After everyone left, I still stood there alone to look at my footprint and tried to recall when that had happened. I was a very active boy. Many times, I climbed to the roof to play with my kite, but I always checked my feet to see if they were clean or not before climbing.</p>
			<p class="indent">I cleaned my feet and left them wet then climbed up there. I put my wet foot onto that footprint, so when I took my foot out, I could compare my footprint and the existing one. I realized that the footprint was slightly larger than mine, especially the toes. The footprint was not mine. But whose footprint was that? Was that person the prime suspect in my house theft? I started thinking of a plan to arrest that person by myself.</p>
			<p class="indent">According to my speculation, that person was among our neighbors because a neighbor could enter my house without bothering Potato, our dog. Moreover, the house was empty when all of us went to Thien’s house for lunch. That person could use the vacant house next door to implement his plans. The tenant who lived in that house already moved out a few months before but forgot to lock the door. The thief would intrude into that house, climb to the roof, walk over to my house, then go down to the water container.</p>
			<p class="indent">The next day, I asked Dad to allow me to stay home alone at noon and study my lesson, with the reason being that it was very quiet at that time, so I could concentrate. I could go to Thanh’s house later for lunch. Dad agreed with that idea.</p>
			<p class="indent">From that day on, every afternoon, when Dad and my siblings went to Thien’s house for lunch, I stayed home to study my homework.</p>
			<p class="indent">When Dad, Mai, and Thang left the house for lunch, I started to set the trap. I opened the door, which connected the living area with the water container area, closed my closet, then shut all the windows. I unlatched the kitchen door, which was the second entrance to my house from the backyard, and used a piece of carton to jam it. With that method, the door could not open accidentally, and I could open it from outside. After that, I opened the front door, walked out, and locked it as if going out for lunch. I walked in the direction of Thien’s house, but at the intersection one hundred meters away from my house, I quickly turned to the lane behind our building. I ran fast to the kitchen door, opened it, and slid into my house.</p>
			<p class="indent">After locking that door, I went to the living area and took my books out to study quietly while listening for any strange sound. Although I was very hungry, I strove to overcome that inconvenience. About five minutes before Dad and my siblings came home, I secretly walked out of my house, heading to Thien’s house for a late lunch.</p>
			<p class="indent">A week elapsed, and nothing happened. Two weeks, then three weeks passed, and still nothing happened. I started to get discouraged and wanted to give up my plan. I then consoled myself; the thief also recognized his problem when my parents scolded us about their money disappearance.</p>
			<p class="indent">A few weeks later, I took out the box to count my money and realized that it had decreased by 20 piasters. I thought someone had stolen my money. I reported that to my parents, but they did not believe me. They all thought that I set up a fake story to cover the crime that I had committed.</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">We lived at Vung Tau for a few years, but we never had a chance to ride a boat to the open sea. We imagined how much fun it must be to sit on a big boat on the open sea with the blue sky and waves. All of us wished to have that chance. Dad knew it, but we were poor, so we could not afford to rent a boat.</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, at dinner, Dad happily told us, “There is a person from Saigon who invited us to go out to sea on his new big boat this Sunday. Do you like that?”</p>
			<p class="indent">All of us were so glad, and we simultaneously answered, “We like that, Dad .”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mai asked, “Why did that person invite us, Dad ?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“He is a friend of mine. I helped him in paper procedure to build that boat. This Sunday is the inauguration day of his boat.”</p>
			<p class="indent">We all were very excited and longed for that day.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sunday came, and Dad led the three of us to the Cau Da (stone bridge) at the Front Beach (Bai Truoc); there we saw a big powerboat waiting for us.</p>
			<p class="indent">That boat carried us to the high sea; we saw the houses at Front Beach became smaller and smaller, then only some tall buildings of the town were visible. For the first half hour, we were delighted with the immense sea and the sky. But later, I started feeling nauseated. I saw my sister begin vomiting over the other side of the boat. I tried to suppress something in my stomach from coming out. Soon, that something became stronger than my powers of suppression. Finally, I gave up and started vomiting with my sister. First, we threw up our food, then water, and eventually only our saliva and bile that left a bitter taste in my mouth. We only wished the boat would return home as soon as possible.</p>
			<p class="images2"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute14" src="image/Image1539.png" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\hai du.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">Only Thang and Dad seemed to be okay.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mai and I lay on the boat deck and vomited all afternoon, while the fishermen and other people screamed with joy at each good catch.</p>
			<p class="indent">While returning home, I asked Mai, “How do you like the boat ride?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Oh my goodness! I thought I lost my life. I’ll never go on a boat to the high sea again. And how are you? Do you like it?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I stuck out my tongue. “I’ll never go to the high sea in a boat again. I am so seasick.”</p>
			<p class="indent">That evening, Thanh went to my house and asked us to go to the beach to enjoy the sea breeze. Thanh was among my best friends. For that reason, when I had troubles, I always talked to her and her brother, Thien.</p>
			<p class="indent">On the beach, we looked for a quiet, dark area to sit and chat. I took wet sand to build a statue of an Olympic athlete running with a torch in his hand; Thanh and my siblings were chatting, watching my work.</p>
			<p class="indent">Thanh asked me, “What happened to the stolen money?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “Thanh, it is hard to solve.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thanh asked, “Why’s that, Hiep?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Someone stole my parents’ money and mine too.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Really?” Thanh surprised.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Do you suspect anyone?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“No, I don’t.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Have you reported this to your parents?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I did, but my parents believe I am playing the game ‘vua an cuop, vua la lang’ (robbing someone and then yelling for help) to drive their focus to someone else.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Really? Why don’t you vindicate yourself?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I sighed. “I tried but failed. The only way to clear the theft is to investigate myself and find another suspect.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thanh said, “I support you! Come on, Hiep!”</p>
			<p class="indent">I had finished the statue. Thanh and my siblings circled around to admire my work. Suddenly, some people passed by, and one of them accidentally kicked my statue, breaking its head.</p>
			<p class="indent">Every one of us yelled simultaneously, “Oh my goodness!”</p>
			<p class="indent">The people turned back and used a flashlight to look at my statue.</p>
			<p class="indent">One of them said in English, “We are really sorry!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Another said, “It is a nice statue. We are very sorry! It is too dark over here, so we could not see that.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Then he asked us, “Who made this?”</p>
			<p class="indent">My English, at that time, was very bad. I did not have enough terms for regular conversation, plus I was so nervous that my mouth seemed to be frozen.</p>
			<p class="indent">He repeated very slowly, “Who made this statue?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Finally, I had to answer with my terrible English, “I made it.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He said, “It looks pretty good. Do you want to go to Taiwan to learn art? I am a member of the Taiwanese Embassy in Saigon. If you wish to do so, I will help you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought if I went there to study, it would be very hard to see my parents and my siblings. I would miss them a lot. Several times, I thought I would never see them again. The days I lived in Hai Phong, waiting for my family suddenly appeared in my mind. At that time, I realized that the love for my parents and siblings is very precious. That love is the most precious thing in our lives.</p>
			<p class="indent">The man urged me, “What do you think?” He took out a business card and gave it to me. “Take this! Keep in touch!”</p>
			<p class="indent">I shook my head and said, “No, thank you! I don’t like to go to Taiwan.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Those people left there after that.</p>
			<p class="indent">Thanh asked me, “Why did you turn them down? You missed a good chance to go abroad.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I knew Thanh never had an experience like mine in her life.</p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “I’m still too young to go abroad. I would miss my family if I went there.”</p>
			<p class="xxx">*****</p>
			<p class="indent">One day, at break time, Duc Phan asked me, “Hiep, after school, would you like go to my house? By the way, I’ll let you borrow a Chinese novel to read.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Duc and I had been friends for a long time, but I did not have a chance to visit his house. I thought I have to track down the thief at noon. Only on Sundays, we prepare lunch at home.</p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute15" src="image/Image1548.jpg" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\Gia dinh Vung Tau.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “How about this coming Sunday? Today I’m busy.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Duc smiled, “That’s fine.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I accepted his invitation. “I would like to, but I don’t know how to get to your house.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“So on Sunday, I will come to your house, then we’ll all go together.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“That’s fine!”</p>
			<p class="indent">That was the first time I came to see his family.</p>
			<p class="indent">The following Sunday afternoon, Duc Phan came to my house, and we rode bicycles to his. At Nga Nam (Five-Road-Intersection), a remote location about two kilometers from my house, I saw two boys standing by the roadside. One held a sickle and the other held a yoke. Coming closer, I realized one of them was Mui, but I did not know the other. At the same time, Mui also recognized us.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mui put his yoke down to block our way, so we had to stop. I planned to say something to ease the mood, but seeing his provocation, I felt angry. If I spoke softly, he would think I was afraid of him.</p>
			<p class="indent">For that reason, I asked normally, “What do you want, Mui?”</p>
			<p class="indent">He said, “I don’t want anything at all. I just want to see the Northerners eat wooden fish. Hahaha.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I wanted to show my friendly attitude with those boys by staying there alone. Moreover, I knew Duc was a weak, timid student, so I did not want him to get hurt if they fought us.</p>
			<p class="indent">I turned to Duc and said, “Take your bike and mine, then go to that corner. Watch out for thieves. Let me talk with this guy.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Duc did as I said. He stood there and waited for me.</p>
			<p class="indent">I said to Mui, “Many times, you have hit my friends. Many times, you have insulted us, but I have had to yield to you. Not because I am afraid of you, but because I don’t want to make any trouble. However, I want you to understand that discrimination is not a good thing, so we should settle this matter peacefully.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mui put on airs. “Hey! Fuck you! What did you say, little Northerner?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked, “Why do you say bad words to me?”</p>
			<p class="indent">He repeated, “Fuck you! I can say whatever I want to! You want to fight?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I lost my temper and raised my voice. “I don’t want to fight, but I’m letting you know that this is the last time I’ll yield to you. I asked you a favor, not to insult the Northerners!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mui put on airs again. “Fuck you, Northerner!”</p>
			<p class="indent">I pointed to Mui. “This is the last time that I ask you to stop calling us as Northerners who eat wooden fish.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The other boy acrimoniously said, “If you point your finger at my friend, I will smash your face into two pieces.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I turned to that boy. “I don’t talk to—”</p>
			<p class="indent">Before the word “you” could come out of my mouth, that guy threw a fierce punch to my nose, which made me see a thousand stars. At the same time, Mui added another one to my chin. I fell down on the grass at the roadside with my nose and mouth bleeding.</p>
			<p class="indent">I was very hurt because of the two strong blows of Mui and his friend. I tried to stand up, but I could not. They both stood with their arms akimbo.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mui said, “How do you feel, son? Come here! Dad will teach you some more lessons. Hahaha.”</p>
			<p class="indent">His voice woke me up. I recalled a few days ago, Mui beat Duc Cong up, and many times, he had insulted or hit my friends and me. My blood boiled with anger, and I could not control myself.</p>
			<p class="indent">I suddenly sprang to him and threw a hard punch to his face. Mui was laughing, and he did not think I could attack him that fast. He retreated a few steps, but his friend attacked me from behind, so I had to turn around to fight back.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many passersby stopped to watch the fight. They seemed to be enjoying our match, but no one tried to dissuade us. For Duc Phan himself, he trusted in my ability, and he knew he could not help me at all, so he also stayed out of the combat.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mui and his friend had good boxing skills. He hit my face several times. Although I was hurt, I had to control myself, using my mind over the pain. At the same time, I had to fight with two opponents, so I had a lot of troubles. If I fought the guy in front, the other attacked me from behind.</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought, “I need to knock out one guy, then deal with the second one.”</p>
			<p class="indent">So I had to change my strategy. The sun, at that time, was in the west, also creating trouble for me when I attacked an enemy in that direction. An idea suddenly popped into my mind, and I carried it out right away. I punched Mui vehemently to force him to retreat eastward and ignored the other boy who was chasing after me, punching my back. I took advantage of his shadow on the road, and at the right time, when I realized that he did not protect himself, all of a sudden, I turned back and threw a fierce punch to his nose to knock him down to the ground. That guy was so terrified when he saw his blood falling on the ground; he got up and ran away from the fight.</p>
			<p class="indent">I was almost in a faint because of exhaustion. Turning back to deal with Mui, my neck was squeezed hard by his hands. Mui was also very tired. He breathed like a cow, but he was still much better than me. I tried my best to loosen his hands, but I could not. I thought the fight was over.</p>
			<p class="indent">Suddenly, I recalled a technique of a judo player in a Japanese movie that I had recently watched. In the movie, the judo player was choked by his enemy. On the verge of dying, he used a technical move called “sutemi waza” to defeat his enemy.</p>
			<p class="indent">I applied that move immediately by throttling him. I used both my hands to squeeze his neck and tried to push him backward. His reaction was opposite to mine, so he pushed me backward too. I waited for just that moment. I fell to the ground and pulled him along, while my right foot trampled on Mui’s groin. My hand pulled him down and my leg stretched out. When his body was up in the air, I shoved him hard.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mui screamed horribly, “Oh! Oh!” then boom,” he fell to the water runoff by the roadside. Luckily for us, the runoff was there; if not, his leg or arm would be broken, and I would rue about it.</p>
			<p class="indent">At that moment, some old people came to dissuade us. The fight was really over.</p>

			<p class="indent">One day, when I was studying, I heard someone call at the front door, “Hiep, Mai, are you home?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I realized it was Vy’s voice. Vy is the son of a high-ranking public employee who was Dad’s friend, living three houses away from mine. Vy himself was also a friend of mine. He was one year younger than me, but because he had enough food to eat, he was bigger than me.</p>
			<p class="indent">Vy called more urgently at the front door, “Hiep, Mai, Thang! Are you home?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I thought that guy probably was the prime suspect, so I did not reply. I put away my book and went to the restroom, which was next to the water container. Behind the door of the restroom, there was a big earthen jar to contain water for cleaning purpose. I softly opened the restroom door, then sat on that jar, looking out through the interstice of the door.</p>
			<p class="indent">Vy started to shake the door and the windows, as he kept calling my sister and me. For that reason, I confirmed to myself that he was the one who had stolen our money.</p>
			<p class="indent">A moment later, Vy stopped shaking my house’s door and windows. I heard him entering the vacant house next door. Vy used that to pave the way for entering my house. He went into that house and climbed to the roof by using the water container. I heard him walking on his tiptoes on the roof. I excitedly waited for what would happen next.</p>
			<p class="indent">Soon, he appeared on the roof of my house. Through the crack of the door, I could see him very clearly. He sat on the roof, looking to the restroom, and observed the situation in my house. He could not see me because I was in the dark area. The restroom door was wide open, and he saw no one in there.</p>
			<p class="indent">Perhaps feeling safe and confident, he started to get down from the roof. I waited for him to walk to the bedroom, and sneaked after him. As usual, he went to my closet, opened the door, then grabbed the money box. As he was taking some money out of the box, I grabbed his hand. He gave a gasp when he saw me. His face became pale, and his forehead broke out into sweat as if he had just taken a hot shower. I could see the pain and fright in his eyes.</p>
			<p class="indent">I took pity on him, so I spoke sweetly. “Vy, don’t be panicky. Follow me to the living room!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Vy obeyed my words and went to the living room with me.</p>
			<p class="indent">I pointed to a chair and told him, “Sit down!”</p>
			<p class="indent">He timidly sat on that chair.</p>
			<p class="indent">I took out paper and a pen, “Vy, I will give you a way to save your face as well as your family. Now, copy down whatever I read. Take the pen!”</p>
			<p class="indent">He picked up the pen.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Are you ready?” I asked.</p>
			<p class="indent">He nodded.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Today’s date…” I said. “My name is Vy H, resident of…”</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked him to write the facts, acknowledging his intrusion into my house to steal.</p>
			<p class="indent">After finishing the paper, he asked, “Can I go home now?”</p>
			<p class="indent">I shook my head and said, “Stay in your seat. Wait for my father to come home. Do you have any objection about your confession?”</p>
			<p class="indent">He shook his head.</p>
			<p class="indent">At 1:00 p.m., I heard Thang’s voice from the gate. “Hiep, why don’t you go to take your lunch? You are not hungry, are you?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mai chimed in, “He is very good in dieting.”</p>
			<p class="indent">As they opened the door, they were very surprised to see Vy and me sitting on the chairs. I reported everything to Dad . He allowed Vy to go home. After that, we solved the problem smoothly.</p>
			<p class="indent">I was very happy to solve the problem and prove that I was innocent.</p>
			<p class="indent">One evening, the following weekend, Suy came to see me. At the same time, Yen, a friend of my sister, also came to see her. Luckily, that evening, my parents were not at home. We talked about our lessons, then went to see a movie at the movie theater close to my house.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because the movie was too violent, Yen and Mai left there before the movie ended. Suy, Thang, and I stayed there and enjoyed the movie. When we were fascinated by the story, Mai and Yen frighteningly rushed to my place.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mai gasped and said, “Hiep, there was…someone intruding…into our house for…burgling our property.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I did not answer but rushed out of the movie theater. Suy, Mai, Yen, and Thang ran behind. When we were at the intersection, twenty meters away from our house, I paused to wait for them. It was very dark in the house because we had turned off all the lights before leaving. Because the windows had steel bars, we didn’t need to shut the window panels. Looking through the window, we could not see a thing from the street.</p>
			<p class="indent">I asked Mai, “How do you know there is an intruder in our house?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“As Yen and I arrived home, a few minutes ago,” she answered, “through the front window, we saw something white, as if a person were moving in the house.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Yen chimed in, “That is true. That person is very quick. I saw a white shirt, then in the blink of an eye, he disappeared.”</p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “What a stupid burglar! He tried to burglarize our home at night but has a white shirt.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I saw a white shirt,” Mai confirmed.</p>
			<p class="indent">I said, “Each one take a rod! Mai and Yen, stand here observing. If you see someone climb to the roof or jump over the wall, you scream for help as loud as possible. Thang, you go to Mr. Hui’s house and do the same thing. Suy, please go to the area behind my kitchen. From that location, you can observe the entire area. Your function is to prevent someone trying to get away to your area. All of you remember, if you see the intruder, chase after him, and use the rod, whip him very hard while you keep calling for help. Do you understand?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Okay!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Now move!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Everyone went to the position that I had appointed.</p>
			<p class="indent">I pretended not to suspect a thing and walked to the door casually while whistling. I used the key to unlock the door slowly. As soon as the door was unlocked, I abruptly opened the door, then quickly jumped sideways to prevent someone from springing out and hitting or stabbing me.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the door burst open, I saw something black and white jumping out from the house. The “burglar” wagged his tail to greet me. It was Potato, our dog. In the house, we saw a lot of dog footprints on the table.</p>
			<p class="indent">When my sister and Yen came home with the memory of the burglary that had happened several days ago, they were thinking that someone might intrude into the house again. When they saw Potato running on the table and jumping down in the darkness, they imagined that was a burglar.</p>
