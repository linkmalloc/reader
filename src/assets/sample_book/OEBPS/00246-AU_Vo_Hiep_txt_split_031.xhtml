			<p class="firstpara"><span class="_idgendropcap">A</span>fter the black April 30, I tried to analyze the source of the war between North and South Vietnam and the reason for the collapse of the Republic of Vietnam. Finally, I came up with a conclusion: the abandonment the South Central Plateau and the corruption of South Vietnam was only the trigger that made our country collapse quicker and more mournfully. The fate of South Vietnam had been decided a few years before, so sooner or later, this country would no longer exist.</p>
			<p class="indent">Why had the United States helped my country for more than twenty years? Did that mean the US government loved the South Vietnamese and hated the North Vietnamese? The answer is NO.</p>
			<p class="indent">Did the US want to occupy Vietnam and convert this country to a colony as the Communist propaganda said? The answer is NO.</p>
			<p class="indent">To understand the heart of that problem, we need to take a look at world history since the eighteenth century.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1789, a revolution took place in France. That revolution brought up a question of social equality. In 1848, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published a book called <span class="italics1">The</span> <span class="italics1">Communist Manifesto </span>that pointed out a new economic theory. Marx and Engels’ theory was to make society become equal; there would be no social classes. A dream society is one in which no person is richer than any other and no person is poorer than any other. To reach that kind of society, we must overthrow feudal government, eradicate the richest class, and get rid of capitalism.</p>
			<p class="indent">After the publication of that book, a series of revolutions occurred in Europe, but they all were extinguished. In October 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution, led by Vladimir I. Lenin, successfully overthrew the Russian kingdom. From that day on, a new kind of government ruled the largest country of the world, a government controlled by the Communist Party.</p>
			<p class="indent">Most Western countries recognized the Soviet Union, except the US. In 1934, the US admitted this country and allowed it to be a member of the League of Nations.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the beginning of the ’20s, Communism expanded to China; however, the Communists and Kuomintang coexisted peacefully. In the ’30s, these two parties started colliding. In October 1934, the Chinese Red Army tried to get rid of Kuomintang spies by attacking a Chiang base. Chiang retaliated and encircled Mao and Zhou. The Red Army was relatively weak at that time and the Long March began.</p>
			<p class="indent">At that time, some of the most powerful capitalist nations, such as the US, United Kingdom, and France still ignored that matter because Communism was only practiced within the USSR.</p>
			<p class="indent">When Hitler came to power in Germany, those nations realized that Nazism was more dangerous than Communism. In 1939, Hitler invaded Poland and then Western European countries. The United States took part in the Alliance to resist the Nazi powers. In May 1941, Germany attacked the USSR, and the US gave them weapons to fight back. All countries, Communist and Capitalist, fought shoulder to shoulder against Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>
			<p class="indent">Before August 1945, Ho Chi Minh contacted the US government, asking for help to regain independence from France, and he got a favorable commitment. The reason was that America, at that time, did not see any danger in Communism.</p>
			<p class="indent">When WWII ended in 1945, with the help of the Red Army of the USSR, all the countries of Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Albania became Communist. In Asia, North Korea also fell into the control of that party.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the highest ideal of Communism, national boundaries would no longer exist; the whole world becomes one single nation. It is the “Gioi Dai Dong” or the “Global Single Nation.” Their slogan was “Eradicate the Capitalist.”</p>
			<p class="indent">At that point, the US, the UK, and France recognized the danger of Communism. They started thinking of uniting with each other to protect against that threat.</p>
			<p class="indent">During WWII, Germany occupied French territory, so France lost control of Indochina. On March 9, 1945, France was kicked out of Vietnam by the Japanese, and a government inclining to Japan was set up, led by Prime Minster Tran Trong Kim. After that, millions of Vietnamese died of famine when the Japanese ordered the destruction of rice fields and planted jute for war supply and used rice to replace coal in running locomotives. Moreover, when the war just ended, 200,000<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-005">84</a></span></span> Chiang Kai-Shek’s soldiers entered North Vietnam to disarm Japanese without food, which also contributed to the famine.<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-004">85</a></span></span> The Vietnamese hated everyone: French, Japanese, and Chinese.</p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute86" src="image/Image2179.png" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q I\CROSSING 17TH PARALLEL\PIC 101.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="indent">After the Japanese surrendered in August 1945, Vietnamese of all different political parties overthrew Emperor Bao Dai and Kim’s government, which were considered a puppet of the French and Japanese. Ho Chi Minh of the Communist Party and other Nationalists set up a coalition government.</p>
			<p class="indent">When Viet Minh controlled North Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh asked Major of OSS Archimedes La Patti to help him deliver some letters to President Truman. In those letters, Uncle Ho asked the US to help Vietnam out of French domination.<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-003">86</a></span></span> During World War II, Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap cooperated with OSS<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-002">87</a></span></span> to rescue US Flying Tiger pilots, who were shot down by Japanese in China. But President Truman ignored<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-001">88</a></span></span> them and supported France instead. Then the Vietnam-French War took place.</p>
			<p class="indent">The reason why Ho Chi Minh wrote several letters to President Truman was because of the Atlantic Charter that was signed between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. On August 14, 1941, US and Great Britain stated the ideal goals of the war: no territorial aggrandizement, no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people (self-determination). Charter ultimately did serve as an inspiration for colonial subjects throughtout the Third World, from Algeria to Vietnam, as they fought for independence.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1946, France returned to Vietnam with the help of the UK, when British forces had a duty to disarm the Japanese in South Vietnam. The whole powerful Western countries of the world recognized Indochina as a French colony. The government of Ho lost its position in the world. On December 19, 1946, Ho declared the war to regain the independence of our nation, then withdrew from Hanoi to mountainous areas to build up armed forces with sharp-ended bamboo sticks and knives.</p>
			<p class="indent">France tried to oppress the weak Vietnamese forces, but with the determination and thirst for independence of our people, they could not do that.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1949, Mao and China’s Communist Party drove Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters to Taiwan, then set up a huge Communist country. The threat to the Capitalist Bloc grew bigger.</p>
			<p class="indent">After, 1949, China aided Vietnam to fight, so France lost many battles. To protect Capitalism, America aided France, although they disliked each other.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another danger came to the US and capitalist countries right after WWII ended. Stalin ordered his scientists and engineers to research and develop atomic bombs and rockets. In 1949, they exploded their first atomic bomb.</p>
			<p class="indent">On June 25, 1950, the Communist forces of North Korea crossed the 38th Parallel to invade South Korea. That was proof that Communists were carrying out the slogan “Eradicate the Capitalist.”</p>
			<p class="indent">To block the expansion of the Red Wave that eroded to South Korea and Japan, America used the United Nations to create an alliance force to help South Korea. America successfully pushed the North Korean and Red Chinese forces back to their previous place. After many defeats, China and North Korea had to accept a truce plan on July 27, 1953. Three quarters of the Chinese army did not wish to return to their homeland that was controlled by the Communists.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1952, the US successfully developed the H-bomb, a bomb whose trigger was atomic, with a destructive power hundred times greater than a regular atomic bomb. To follow the US closely, the USSR tested its first H-bomb the following year.</p>
			<p class="indent">By the end of 1953, General Henry Eugène Navarre, the commander-in-chief of French forces, wanted to bring an end to the Vietnam War. The order was given to drop three paratroop battalions to Điê<span class="times-reg">̣</span>n Biên Phu<span class="times-reg">̉</span> Valley to cut Viet Minh’s supplies from Vietnam to the northern part of Laos. He thought he might draw Viet Minh into a conventional war, so he could get rid of his enemy.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1954, when the Battle of Điê<span class="times-reg">̣</span>n Biên Phu<span class="times-reg">̉</span> began and showed a bad sign for French forces, the US and France started thinking of a new method to block the advance of Communism to Southeast Asia. At that point, a new strategy was developed and a new political face had to be introduced to the southern part of Vietnam, which was controlled by France: Mr. Ngo Dinh Diem, a person inclined to America rather than to France. France agreed to give up Vietnam to America but maintain Laos and Cambodia as neutral countries for its benefit.</p>
			<p class="indent">On May 8, 1954, a conference was held in Geneva, Switzerland, to bring peace to Indochina. Many countries participated in the conference, including France, the Communists of Vietnam represented by Ho Chi Minh’s government, the Nationalists of Vietnam represented by Bao Dai’s government, Laos, and Cambodia. In addition, the USSR, Red China, the US, and Britain also participated in that conference.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mr. Diem was a former secretary of Bao Dai’s government before 1945. He had submitted a proposal that gave the Vietnamese government more power. But the proposal was denied by France, so Mr. Diem resigned and went to America to live. At that time, Mr. Diem lived in Maryland. Bao Dai summoned him back to Paris and conferred him as the Prime Minister of Vietnam.</p>
			<p class="indent">In Indochina, the war to regain independence from France was moving. On July 20, 1954, France had to sign a peace accord at Geneva, after losing a battle at Điê<span class="times-reg">̣</span>n Biên Phu<span class="times-reg">̉</span> with 6,000 men killed and more than 10,000 taken prisoner.</p>
			<p class="indent">To block the expansion of Communism, America and Bao Dai’s government did not participate in the accord signing. America then helped Mr. Ngo Dinh Diem to set up a nationalist government in the South. That was the same thing that they did in Korea.</p>
			<p class="indent">By that accord, France recognized the independence of Vietnam and totally withdrew from our country by the end of 1955. Vietnam was temporarily divided in two parts: North and South, with the border being the Ben Hai River at the 17th Parallel. The Communists controlled North Vietnam, and the Nationalists controlled South Vietnam. All armed forces of Communists had relocated to the North, and those of the Nationalists had moved to the South. The North Vietnamese might move to the South, and the South Vietnamese might move the North, if they wished to do so.</p>
			<p class="indent">But the Communists did not move all of their forces to the North and left 10,000 cadres behind, disguised as civilians. They had planned an uprising in case the accord collapsed. They also did not allow the North Vietnamese who lived in the areas under their control, to move freely to the South. Only the ones who lived in French-controlled areas before October 1954 were able to move freely to the South. About 850,000 to 1,000,000 people left their homeland in North Vietnam to migrate to the South; most were Catholics.</p>
			<p class="indent">Actually, at the beginning, Mr. Diem did not pay attention of moving Catholic Northerner to South. He thought only rich business persons and landlords would go to Saigon. But the chief of CIA in Saigon, Ed Lansdale, encouraged him to do so as many as possible (see <span class="italics1">Victory at Any Cost</span>, page 217). Mr. Diem agreed. Ed ordered his agents to make fake-unreal news: Maria had moved to the South. A couple weeks later, Jesus also moved to the South. With very simple thinking, Catholic persons migrated to the South in large numbers. With this measure, it would help that Saigon had the advantage in propaganda.</p>
			<p class="indent">The threat from the Communists grew bigger and bigger. They created the Warsaw Treaty Organization and many movements in the Eastern European Bloc tried to break away from Moscow and were quelled. In June 1956, the Polish army put down a revolt in Poland against the Soviets. In October of the same year, Soviet troops ruthlessly crushed an uprising in Hungary.</p>
			<p class="indent">From 1954 to 1956, Hanoi waited for an election that united North and South, as signed in the Geneva Accord. They also needed to have time for their troops to take a long rest after the fatigue of war, as well as to bring new soldiers to replace those lost during the war. For that reason, people on both sides of the 17th Parallel had a peaceful period.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1956, US Senator John F. Kennedy supported President Diem of South Vietnam, who boycotted the election to unite North and South. That was the strategy that explained why they did not sign the Geneva Accord. Vietnam’s Communist Party and Ho Chi Minh were angered by that fact, so they tried to find a way to “liberate” South Vietnam. The first thing to do was to build a secret trail to transport soldiers, human powers, weapons, and food. They started to build on the west side of Truong Son Chain, the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which lies in Laos’ territory, to avoid a direct attack from South Vietnamese and US troops.</p>
			<p class="indent">Quite a few other countries, such as India, Indonesia, Angola, Algeria, Egypt, and Cuba, inclined to the Communist theory; the whole capitalist world saw a threat to their countries. Communist countries united with each other like a block of metal under the leadership of the USSR.</p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute87" src="image/Image2186_copy.jpg" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\C-47 SKYTRAIN.png"/></p>
			<p class="indent">For that reason, America aided Chiang’s government in maintaining Nationalist control of Taiwan. Many military pacts were formed to protect alliances, such as NATO and the South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO).</p>
			<p class="indent">The main goal of America was not only protecting Korea or Vietnam from Communist expansion (so from these countries they could invade other neighbors), but also to defeat and get rid of Communism.</p>
			<p class="indent">But how could America do that? With powerful nuclear and high technology and more than 200 million people in the USSR, it was not an easy thing to deal with. In addition, China had a population of more than 700 million; America (with its population of 190 million) and other capitalist countries were much smaller (census during ’50s). How could capitalist countries win a World War III, if that happened between Communists and Capitalists?</p>
			<p class="indent">The Cold War era began. To win the war, the USSR tried to expand its propaganda mechanisms and use it to show their muscles. They tried to prove to the world that the most powerful country on earth was not the US but the USSR in every field: atomic arms, rockets, sports, and sciences. And a race between the USSR and the US began.</p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute88" src="image/Image2193_copy.png" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\F-104 STARFIGHTER.png"/></p>
			<p class="indent">In the arms race, the USSR produced an H-bomb with a power equivalent to multi-megatons; in ’60s, they tested a fifteen-megaton H-bomb while the US bomb was only one megaton. On October 30, 1961, Soviet Union tested the Tsar Bomba, a hydrogen bomb. That is the most powerful nuclear weapon ever created. The bomb had a yield of 50 megatons of TNT, which is equivalent to about 1,570 times the combined energy of the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
			<p class="indent">They also built a submarine larger than that of the US. In the rocket field, the USSR also led the world with an ICBM that could hit a target 12,000 kilometers away, while the US missile could reach a distance of only 10,000 kilometers.</p>
			<p class="indent">In sports, the USSR also invested a lot of money to train their athletes with the hope that those athletes could bring home more Olympic medals than any country in the world, including the US. In fact, those athletes were real professionals because they got a salary from the government, and all day long and all year round, they practiced and practiced.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the sciences, on October 4, 1957, the USSR launched Sputnik I, the first man-made satellite, which astonished the whole world and showed everyone that they were the leader and the mightiest country. Sputnik I was developed and designed by Korolev’s group of scientists and engineers. Sputnik I was a sphere 23 inches in diameter, weighing 184 pounds, and equipped with two radio transmitters; when it reached orbit, a simple message of “beep-beep” signals was sent back to earth.</p>
			<p class="indent">Actually, both the US and the USSR had a space plan since the beginning of the ’50s, but the US concentrated on ICBMs more, to have an advantage in military arms.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the whole world hailed the USSR for that, the Americans were completely panicked and disappointed. President Eisenhower consoled America by saying that Sputnik was only a piece of metal, and the US would launch a satellite in December 1957, only two months later. The space race began.</p>
			<p class="indent">But on November 3, 1957, the USSR launched its second satellite, Sputnik II. This was not a metal block as depicted by Eisenhower’s government, but a huge spacecraft with a weight of 1,120 pounds and a dog named Laika traveling inside. Once more, the rest of the world congratulated the USSR, and the US had to investigate their education. A question arose: how far behind in mathematics and science was America?</p>
			<p class="indent">As President Eisenhower promised, the US prepared to launch its first satellite on time. In contrast to the USSR, who launched Sputnik secretly, the US launch was open to everyone who wanted to witness it. However, the Vanguard booster only rose a few feet off the pad, then fell back to the ground. It was a national humiliation for American citizens!</p>
			<p class="indent">A group of army engineers and scientists led by Wehrner von Braun, the father of Germany’s V2 rocket, urged President Eisenhower to turn on the green light, so his team could launch a satellite two months after that. The president agreed and allowed them to complete it in three months. But Von Braun’s team finished in less than sixty days. On January 31, 1958, the whole world cheered the US with its first satellite, the Explorer 1. The Explorer 1 was small but full of advanced electronic devices and discovered the Van Allen Radiation Belt. The US was back on track in the space race.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1957, when Soviet-Chinese friendship was very sweet, the USSR helped China to build an atomic weapon. Many scientists and engineers of Red China came to study and research at Star City in the USSR. It was very dangerous to the world. One way that America could paralyze Communism was to break the unity of those countries.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1958, Mao declared that China would develop atomic bombs, missiles, and satellites. The next year, they successfully tested the first rocket. The same year, the Soviet-Chinese friendship became sour after a dispute occurred between the USSR and China over Albania, when that country tried to have a close relationship with China.</p>
			<p class="indent">France’s ambition was to maintain its benefit in Indochina by converting Laos and Cambodia into two neutral countries. America had trouble detecting Communist activity in those countries, especially in Laos, because this country was a mountainous country. Communists also stirred a guerilla war in these two countries to help North Vietnam build the Ho Chi Minh and Sihanouk trails.</p>
			<p class="indent">After partial finishing the Ho Chi Minh Trail in December 1959, Ho summoned a general meeting of the Communist Party for the third time and announced a plan to liberate South Vietnam by force. For that reason, Vietnamese of both sides had an extension period of peace from 1956 to the end of 1959. In other words, the Vietnamese had a lucky period from 1954 to 1959 to enjoy the peaceful life under President Diem’s regime. From that day on, the Communist Party ordered undercover cadres living in the South to reactivate, and they sent the cadres back to South Vietnam through that trail. At the same time, they also sent support to South by sea. To deal with that, US had a navy mission to block that activity, which was called Desoto Patrol</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1960, China became stronger and wanted to share the leadership of the Communist world with the USSR. Mao implemented the theory of the Third World and the People’s Liberation Front. The Third World meant all poor nations stayed away from both the USSR and the US. People’s Liberation Front meant using the blue-collar class and rural peasants forming guerilla forces to attack and overthrow all governments on the same side as Western countries.</p>
			<p class="indent">The next year, Hanoi began the NLF in South Vietnam, and from that day on, the peaceful lives of the South Vietnamese under President Diem’s government ended and all started to live in bloody war.</p>
			<p class="indent">China’s ambition created a crack in the unity of the Communist Bloc. The USSR realized that China wanted to share the leadership of the Communist Bloc, and they immediately withdrew all scientists and engineers from China and canceled the atomic program. China became nervous because of that action and did not know what they should do.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the US was struggling to send a monkey into space in an trajectory of a parabola, the USSR once again stopped America’s joy by sending Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin and bringing him back safely.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1962, when Communists had enough power, they attacked ARVN thirty-five times with battalion or larger forces. </p>
			<p class="indent">Also in 1961, China attended None-Aligned convention in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, and created a movement to follow neither the US nor the USSR. As a power country, China took the leadership role of the new pack. The Soviet-Chinese friendship was cracked seriously.</p>
			<p class="indent">Of course, America did not let that chance get away. The US tried to find a way to keep that bloc broken. And America came up with a solution: help China to build an atomic bomb. If China was strong enough, they would confront the USSR’s leadership, and the unity of Communism would be totally collapsed. To carry out that strategy, America secretly helped two nuclear physicists, Chinese Americans, in defecting to China, and the atomic program restarted. The crack in the unity became bigger.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1964, China tested its first atomic bomb and became the fifth country in the world after the US, USSR, UK, and France to own that kind of weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">Returning to the space program, in 1966, the US successfully developed the Saturn 1-B and Saturn V rockets, more powerful than Soviet rockets, and started the Apollo project. After many launches that orbited the earth and the moon, on July 16, 1969, the US launched Apollo 11 with three astronauts: Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins and landed on the moon. Finally, the US won the space race.</p>
			<p class="indent">During that period, China always accused the USSR of betraying Marxism and Leninism by attempting to negotiate with the US and Western European countries. In 1969, the crack in Communist Bloc reached its maximum point, when the USSR and China clashed on the Amur River, a natural boundary between China and the USSR northeast of Benjin. The clash proved to mankind that the theory of Communism was wrong: the Global Single Nation couldn’t be accomplished.</p>
			<p class="indent">By the end of 1969, the US realized that they had succeeded in their global strategy, so Vietnam was no longer a problem for the US. It could be solved easily.</p>
			<p class="indent">After the death of Mr. Ho Chi Minh, on September 2, 1969, coinciding with the independence day of North Vietnam, Vietnamese Communist members divided into two groups: one supported China and the majority supported the USSR. All the aid from the USSR to Hanoi could not cross the territory of China, so they had to transport a longer way by sea.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the beginning of the 1970s, America already controlled every field from weapons to the space program. The unity of the Communist Bloc was broken. North Vietnam’s Communists were not an important factor. It didn’t matter for the US if they won or lost in the South.</p>
			<p class="indent">On February 28, 1972, a treaty was signed between the US and China. The treaty ensured America that after withdrawing from Indochina, the balance of armed forces in the Pacific area would not be affected.</p>
			<p class="indent">In April of 1972, when the relationship between the US and China was very tense, Mr. Nixon, the US president, suddenly went to China to visit. A month later, he went to Moscow for the same purpose. What was the purpose of those visits? Mr. Nixon wanted to show China and the USSR that America was a neutral country, and the US would stay out of any conflict between those two countries.</p>
			<p class="images"><img class="_idgenobjectattribute89" src="image/Image2200_copy.png" alt="E:\Book-Cac bai viet\Book\Q II\Days Without the Sun\F-4J PHANTOM.png"/></p>
			<p class="indent">While Vietnam was no longer an important point, the anti-war movement in the US grew bigger and bigger. The US government had to protect themselves and US citizens but not the Vietnamese. They had to carry out a new strategy.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also at the beginning of the 1970s, America realized that the corruption in South Vietnam became worse. Because of that, they had no chance of winning a Vietnamese war. Moreover, watching two tigers dispute over prey, a resolution would be implemented. America also knew that China and the USSR would hate each other more and more if they disputed over Vietnam, just like in Albania. If the Vietnam War ended, the US need not spend money and human lives. One more advantage that America would get: if Vietnamese Communists totally controlled Vietnam, they could use Vietnam to stop the expansion of Red China into Southeast Asia. The last benefit of that was to settle down the anti-war movement in the US itself. So with one stone, the US could kill four birds.</p>
			<p class="indent">For those reasons, the United States withdrew military forces and terminated aid to South Vietnam. </p>
			<p class="indent">Soon after US withdrawal, China suddenly sent a fleet to occupy the Paracel Islands (Hoang Sa) of South Vietnam. Hoang Sa thus far was a disputed zone between China and Vietnam. During the French domination, that archipelago belonged to Vietnam. When France withdrew in 1955, the South Vietnamese government frequently sent naval forces to control the area. China, at that time, was not interested in those islands very much because the archipelago included many islands with sand and seagulls. But after 1970, oil drilling in the sea became prominent in the eastern sea of Vietnam. China took advantage of the US withdrawing and the treaty between the US and China on February 28, 1972, and they invaded to occupy it.</p>
			<p class="indent">A naval battle took place between South Vietnamese ships and the Chinese fleet. How could we stand against two enemies at a time? Finally, the South Vietnamese naval force had to withdraw. North Vietnam was angry at China too, but they could not do anything because of the Precious Friendship of Communists, but they inclined more toward the USSR.</p>
			<p class="indent">With the bad decision of President Nguyen Van Thieu to withdraw from the plateau, the Republic of South Vietnam was erased from the map of the world. One thing that America did not think of, the Republic of Vietnam collapsed too easily, too soon, too bloody, and too violently.</p>
			<p class="indent">In 1975, North Vietnam claimed that they were victorious; the US announced that they were the loser, and South Vietnam did not say anything at all. This was the first time the most powerful country in the world accepted that they had lost a war. It was ridiculous—the US was not defeated by another giant country but by a tiny one. But who was the real winner? Who was the real loser?</p>
			<p class="indent">Obviously, South Vietnam was the loser, but what about the US and North Vietnam?</p>
			<p class="indent">After the war, Red China got angry at Vietnam because they followed USSR, so they used the Khmer Rouge to attack Vietnam at the border and killed thousands of our people. On April 18, 1978, Khmer Rouge crossed the border to Ba Chuc village, then massacred 3,157 civilians.</p>
			<p class="indent">Vietnamese Communists invaded Cambodia under the command of General Le Duc Anh and drove the Khmer Rouge out of Phnom Penh within a week, then set up a puppet government. China lost the second game.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the end of 1978, Mr. Deng Hsiao P’ing (<span class="ms-gothic">鄧小平</span>), president of China, declared China would teach Vietnam a lesson.</p>
			<p class="indent">On January 30, 1979, Mr. Deng Hsiao P’ing visited the USA and met President Jimmy Carter. America was aware of the China invasion but had no comment. It means they turned on the green light for China.</p>
			<p class="indent">On February 17, 1979, Red China invaded the northern part of Vietnam; in retaliation, Vietnam inclined the USSR, invaded Cambodia, and also carried out P’ing’s declaration, “Give Vietnam a Lesson.” However, the invasion met with strong resistance by Vietnam, and moreover, Mr. Deng Hsiao P’ing already learned a lesson from his ancestor for a thousand years and recently the US: if they hung around in Vietnam for a long time, they would be pushed back with heavy casualties. Those incidents proved that the Communist Bloc was totally broken.</p>
			<p class="indent">For this era, both US and China blocked the trade with Vietnam. Affected by two big countries, many countries followed them, including Southeast Asia ones. Only one country helped Vietnam: Soviet Union. However, this country was not wealthy, so they helped very little. For that time, Vietnam was one of the poorest countries of the world.</p>
			<p class="indent">As the point of view of most South Vietnamese did not like the way that game ended, and many people blamed that the US abandoned South Vietnam. I think that if we want to place blame, we should blame all people who controlled South Vietnam. They did not think of the fate of the country but only of their prosperous families. They did not want to have self-support but live on foreign aid.</p>
			<p class="indent">For the point of view of capitalists and those who wanted to have freedom and destroy Communism, they would like to see that consequence.</p>
			<p class="indent">For global strategy, we must say that the US already played a perfect game to get rid of Communism. But unfortunately, Vietnam is the primary chessman of the US game. Today, Communism is only nominal, but in reality, that theory died after Eastern Europe collapsed in 1989 and the USSR followed in 1991. In China and Vietnam, almost everyone already possessed private properties such as houses, land, shops, and so on. Society’s values were decreasing; corruption expanded.</p>
			<p class="indent">In Vietnam, after controlling the whole nation, the Communists became corrupted. The culture was also affected by the West, such as music and movies. In 1975, the Communists forbade American movies and music, but in the 1990s, many bands sang and played American music.</p>
			<p class="indent">As for the economy, after two decades of controlling, the Vietnamese were still very poor.<span class="superscript"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idfootnotelink" href="00246-AU_Vo_Hiep_txt_split_033.xhtml#footnote-000">89</a></span></span> They had to invite the US to return and help them in the development of the country. At the same time, they sent thousands of students to America to learn economic management.</p>
			<p class="indent">They were the real loser, and America was the winner.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once, I disagreed with the US policy in Vietnam. Just because of the benefit of the United States, hundred thousands of Vietnamese, both North and South, lost their lives. But now, everything is in the past, and because of loving freedom, I must bow to all young men from Vietnam, America, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand, who have sacrificed their lives for freedom, even though, the word “freedom” never existed in my country. I also bow to all youth who died for the independence of Vietnam.</p>
