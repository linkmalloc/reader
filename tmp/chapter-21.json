For that reason, I had to work ten hours a day, and neither had vacations in Saigon to see my parents.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"By that time, the talks between the US and North Vietnam continued, and still, there was no bright light at the end of the tunnel. The war escalated to ever more bloodshed.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The US forces kept landing in my country more and more, and by April of 1969, the total number of soldiers reached its peak at 543,400. Navy and air force also augmented their activities (see the map). The US 7th Fleet with two stations—Yankee in Tonkin Gulf and Dixie in the east side of Vung Tau—increased the sorties, launching more jets to attack the VC in both North and South. For the US Air Force, B-52 bombers used Guam Airfield to attack North and Central Vietnam, and Thailand Base launched B-52 bombers to attack Ho Chi Minh Trail and Hanoi. The B-52 was the most destructive bomber at that time.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Besides the US forces, the other countries also brought armies into Vietnam as requested by the US government. This was only propaganda. The US wanted to show the world that many free world countries wanted to protect South Vietnam from Communists. However, no one believed that.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"But later, October 9, America carried out another measure to shift the heavy burden of the war to ARVN troops. That was the plan of Defense Secretary Melvin Laid which was called Vietnamization.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"But the anti-war movement spread all over the place in the US as well as other countries such as France, West Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, Japan. That movement really harmed the Communist resistance in our country. On November 15, 1969, an anti-war march in Washington, DC, drew a crowd of 300,000 people. Those facts made my resignation determination grew bigger, but I found no one fitted the job.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The movement also grew bigger after the My Lai Massacre. The reason originated from March 1968, when the C Company of the 1st Battalion of the 20th US Infantry opened an operation to My Lai. The company suffered heavy losses, with forty-two soldiers killed by land mines, but no enemy was seen. In February 1970, Lieutenant William Calley led a unit to My Lai Village. The unit also did not see any enemy but arrested eighty civilians. Lieutenant William Calley ordered his men to kill them all, but his men refused his order. He then, with the assistance of Sergeant David Mitchell, opened fire to kill all of them. The unit then continued their mission and killed between 450 to 500 people, including old people, women, and children.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"On May 4, 1970, another protest took place at Kent State University, and the National Guardsmen killed four protesters. Anti-war marches not only occurred in the US but all over the world. In Australia, in September 1970, the Australian Moratorium March drew up to 120,000 people and 300 were arrested.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The Communist unity was clearly broken. Red China wanted to share leadership with the USSR, so they condemned the new USSR policy. In 1961 at the Belgrade, Yugoslavia, conference, China already carried a plan to divide the world into three zones: Capitalist led by the US, Communist led by the USSR, and the Third World that included all poor countries, which would be led by China. The Third World would stay away from Capitalist and Communist blocs of the USSR.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"During that period, the opposition of China against the USSR came to a climax when they clashed at Amur River, a natural border of Siberia and Manchuria. Ironically, the conflict was a consequence of a territory dispute. The clash showed the world that the theory of Communism was totally wrong. Based on the Communist doctrine, at the final phase, all nations of the Communist world would become a single country.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"In South Vietnam at that time, social values became worse than before. Corruption and bribes spread to the whole nation as dangerous contagious diseases. In addition, the anti-war movement in the United States escalated. I saw a bad future for my country. If the corruption practices kept on going that way, our nation could not withstand with the enemy. I hated the Communist regime, but I could not deny the fact that the troops of North Vietnam before 1954 had been lovely. If their troops were still having that attitude, they would conquer the sympathy of South Vietnamese in rural areas easily.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The people of South Vietnam in rural areas were miserable. In the daytime, the bad guys of ARVN bothered them, and at nighttime, the VC intimidated them for agricultural taxes.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I was very busy with my new job. Besides the office time, I had to teach mathematics and physics for some classes that the students needed to take the national examination by the end of that school year. Several times a week, I returned to Cuc’s house to tutor her and her friends Phi, Tam, and Vui.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"One afternoon, Tin Do came to see me. After chatting for a few minutes, Tin let me knew that his cousin Tam—also Cuc’s friend—was in big trouble because her house had been burnt down during a fight between ARVN and VC. The next day, I passed Tam’s house and gave her 10,000 piasters to help her family. That amount of money was half of my monthly salary. She dared not accept it, but I persuaded her many times until finally, she took it tearfully.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Thang, my brother, graduated high school and passed the Baccalaureate II with a very high grade, then joined the South Vietnamese navy force. He was sent to attend an academy of the US Navy at Rhode Island.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"During those days, I was tangled in many troubles. A part the troubles came from the district chief, Le Thom. He wanted me to do many things that made me feel guilty. Another part came from students, their parents, and my friends. They bribed me to make fake graduation certificates.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Le Thom was a captain of an army unit. There were some bad stories about him, although he was a very good fighter. Since the day he assumed the position of District Chief, the VC dared not infiltrate into villages nearby.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"An eleventh grade student of mine, H, was eighteen years old. Her parents decided to make a marriage party for her with a young man of the district. On the eve of their marriage day, someone drove a powerboat, secretly penetrating to her house, and took her away. Later, we learned that the district chief and his followers had taken H to a remote island on the Mekong River. On the day of the marriage ceremony, the groom came, but there was no bride. He went back home without a wife. That fact was a serious insult for H’s parents. A few days later, H’s father committed suicide in order to clean that insult. The district chief married that girl illegally.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"A lot of people always talked about the Swallow Party of Le Thom. One day, Le Thom invited President Nguyen Van Thieu and many top country guests to attend a party, and he entertained the special people with a special dish: swallow meat. He hoped with that distinguished party, he would have some favor in the future. The party was supposed to entertain two hundred people, so the quantity of swallows would be a very high volume. In order to have that amount of swallows, Thom ordered every village chief of nine villages of the district to turn in a few hundred swallows within two weeks.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The Vinh Binh or Phu Phung village chief had a very hard time finding swallows for Thom’s party. At the due date, he only had less than one hundred live swallows. Thom was very angry at that result, so he ordered his subordinates to flog the Vinh Binh chief. For each missing swallow, they would whip him one baton. As a consequence, the village chief’s buttocks were swollen, so he could not walk. Thom ordered him to get busy within a few days or he would be punished severely. The village chief was very sorrowful and did not know how to accomplish his duty. He knew of no way he could do that. Luckily for him, he met a smart person; the person advised him to submit dead sparrows and pluck all their feathers. So he only trapped sparrows instead of swallows. After plucking all the feathers away, swallows and sparrows look alike.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When he turned in the birds, Le Thom asked, “Why do you turn in dead swallows?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The Vinh Binh chief said, “Because in one day, I trapped too many swallows, I put them in a cage with others. Most of them died, and the rest were also at death’s door. For that reason, I had to ask my inferiors to slaughter them all.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Le Thom reckoned that was a good reason and allowed him to go home. As for the other villages’ chiefs, I did not know their fates.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Le Thom not only flogged village chiefs but also officers who were under his control. Many captains and lieutenants had suffered that kind of punishment.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"One time, the district chief was directing a group to build a bridge over the canal. With the full budget of America’s aid, the bridge would be built easily, but someone took a part of the money and put it in their own pockets, so there was lack of cement and steel for building the bridge. They then forced thousands of peasants of the district to go there and build the bridge for free. Those peasants had to take lunch with them. Greed is not limited.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"One day, I taught physics for grade 10. There were some of Le Thom’s nephews and nieces in that class.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When explaining about forces and center of gravity, I said, “A part is stable if the part’s base is large and the center of gravity is close to the base.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Some students asked, “Why is that, Teacher?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I explained it to them, then took an example. “You see the bridge that is being built over the canal. The main column of the bridge is very easy to be collapsed.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The entire class asked, “Is that true, Teacher?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “I just based this on physics’ theory. The upper part of the column is too big and too high to the base so that the center of mass is close to the upper part. If we apply a weak force sideways, that column would collapse. However, we must merely wait and see.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"One student asked, “Do you mean they’re building the bridge improperly, Teacher?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I smiled. “According to my knowledge, the ramp of the bridge would be a series of parabolas or straight lines tangent to each other, but our bridge’s ramp is a straight line, so it is not smooth for cars traveling at the contact point of different slope. However, with the conditions of war, we don’t have a civil engineer to help with building the bridge, so we must accept it.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"*****","$":{"class":"xxx"}},{"_":"At that time, Duong and Thai no longer lived with me. Duong passed the Baccalaureate-Part I and went to Vinh Long to attend twelfth grade, then joined Thu Duc Military Academy. Thai failed the examination and returned to his native village in Ham Long, a district of Ben Tre Province, and joined the ARNV later.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I felt lonely and tried to find a house for lodging. Tin Nguyen, a student of grade 10, came to see me and invited me to lodge at his house. Tin lived there with his mom in a house very close to the Bo Cap Bridge but on the opposite side of Phung Chau Hamlet. Bo Cap Bridge, at that time, was no longer a footbridge. It had been built of cement and steel under Deputy Chief Nguyen Van Y’s direction. The bridge’s width was about one meter, so Phung Chau’s people were very happy when crossing it.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"From that day on, I had some partners to go to school with again.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"At the same time, Mr. Hoa, Hanh’s father, moved his house from Vinh Binh village to Cho Lach. He also resigned from the principal position of the elementary school over there. His action made me respect him a lot because it proved that he did not care for fame and wealth. His house was on the same side as mine but located next to the ferry landing site. At that time, Hanh was no longer a student of mine but a sergeant of the ARVN force. But his sister, My Cong, was an eleventh grader, and My Dung was a ninth grader.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I began to take lunch and dinner at his house. His wife cooked meals for some other people too. Among those was a friend of mine, Captain Hien, the Chief of Police of the district.

That is an illegal action. You and I would be jailed if someone reveals that fake document.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"At that time, all boy students were in hard conditions, because of the war. Any boy student who was eighteen years old but could not graduate ninth grade had to be drafted for military service as a private. If a boy got the ninth grade certificate of junior high, he would be drafted to attend non-commissioned-officer academy.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He besought, “I will not say anything to anyone else. Please do it for me, Teacher.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I still sadly shook my head, although I took pity on that poor boy.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I suggested, “Why don’t you go to My Tho to attend private school for ninth grade? They would provide your requirement. At public school, I cannot satisfy you.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"After a period of imploring in vain, he had to change his strategy.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He said to me, “Teacher! If you help me out of my trouble, my parents will repay your favor.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I knew he implied bribing me. I also knew his family was a rich one of the district.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “Anyway, I cannot help you. Sorry, boy! I cannot do a thing that goes against my morals and my conscience, even for money.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The boy turned around and walked away sorrowfully. I looked after him with mixed emotions.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"That evening, I helped Tin solve some math and physics problems. After that, we went to play billiards until 11:00, then returned home and went to bed.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When I was in a sound sleep, all of a sudden, I heard an old woman yelling with pain and terror, “Help!

The fire had just started a few minutes ago. If the woman could have calmed herself, I thought she could extinguish the fire, but in a panic, she could not do anything. I ran to the riverbank, crossed Bo Cap Bridge, and then rushed hurriedly in that direction. Tin followed right behind me. We saw an old woman alone, sitting in front of the house crying. No one dared to come and help her.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"There were a few reasons that they did not come to help that old miserable lady: Firstly, it was very early in the morning, and at that time, everyone was sound asleep. It was very lazy to do a tough job at that time. Secondly, they feared a VC trap.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When seeing me, she implored in tears, “Teacher, please help!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I asked, “Is there anybody inside, madam?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"She cried and said, “No one but my pig. Teacher, please save my pig.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I knew that woman was very poor. Every day, she brewed , a rice alcohol, and used the remainder to raise pigs for living. For that reason, the pig was her most precious property.

If I am in danger, call someone to help me.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"As he gave a nod of assent, I looked at the house on fire.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"At that point, the fire already flared up. It was too late to save the house. The house was a small one, and I estimated there was nothing too serious when coming inside. Looking at the river, I realized that the tide had ebbed, so it was very hard to get water there. I dashed to an irrigation canal nearby. This kind of canal was about three meters wide, and it allowed water from the river to come in during high tide, then trapped the water in there. The canal also served as a pond to raise fish, lobsters, crabs, or shrimps. I put my military shirt on and jumped into the canal to make myself wet from head to toe, then sprang into the burning house.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"It was terribly hot and smoky because the old lady stored a lot of coconut leaves for alcohol brewing. I ran to the back of the house where the pig case was located. The pig was running back and forth because of the extreme heat. It was a big female pig. Luckily, the fire spread upward faster than sideways, so the pig’s case was not burnt yet.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I kicked a portion of palm-leaf wall down to make a way for the pig to escape. But it was too hot, and the pig did not know which way to run. I kicked and slapped at the pig to force her to run into that hole, but she still ran around. She was too big to carry in my arms. Next to me, a portion of burning roof fell down, which made me feel too hot; my hair and my clothes started to burn. I leaned my back to the wall and used all my strength to push the pig, making her fall down to the irrigation canal.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I planned to go out by the kitchen door, but a pile of coconut leaves was burning over there. For that reason, I had to return to the front door, but the fire was overwhelming. Some burning columns and bars falling down made the entire floor amber. Burning bamboo popped like grenades; a big portion of the burning roof fell onto my shoulder and a lot of my hairs burned up.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I realized there was no way out for me by that direction. I returned to the pig’s case and jumped into the small canal by the hole that the pig made by falling into it.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When I reached the canal, I smelled a terrible odor. That canal was also the place where the pig dumped all her excrement and urine. I had to close my mouth and my eyes firmly to prevent those dirty things going into my body. I groped around to feel the way to get out of the filthy water.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Suddenly, I heard, “Eg! Eg!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I knew that I had touched my new friend that I had just saved.

Those supplies were transported from Compong Som or Sihanouk Ville through the Sihanouk Trail.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"To the international community, the VC always denied all of those trails. There was no Sihanouk Trail, no Ho Chi Minh Trail. The war in South Vietnam was triggered and carried out by the South Vietnamese only to push the Americans out of Vietnam and overthrow the puppet government. North Vietnam did not do anything in the war. That was merely a strategy of propaganda. Unfortunately, most nations of the world believed in that propaganda.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"For that reason, the operation also wanted to show to the whole world that Communists talked and acted differently. However, the giant operation did not have a good result as expected; after moving forty-five kilometers into Cambodian territory, ARVN met only weak resistance from the enemy and destroyed a small amount of ammunition. A big question arose: how could the Communists hide and take away all the important supplies? The same was true in the rescue mission by US forces aiming to save POWs at Son Tay in North Vietnam in the same year.

Only Thom, a few other officers, and I were present in the meeting.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"In the meeting room, he asked me, “Mr. Hiep, why do you and your teachers allow your students to get out of school during school hours?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I thought, ","$":{"class":"indent"},"span":{"_":"The district chief is trying to put the responsibility for the girl’s death on me or my friends.","$":{"class":"italics1"}}},{"_":"I replied, “I don’t know if any teacher allowed them to get out of school or if it was a truancy. But according to the victim’s parents and her friends, she was shot by a soldier in daylight. I will investigate why those students went to that area by tomorrow. If that was the teacher’s fault, I will report that to the Education Department. If that was truancy, it was the students’ fault. I will punish them.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He said, “Do you mean my soldier shot them without any good reason?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I firmly nodded. “That is the fault of your soldiers!

A few days later, the main column of the bridge that was under construction collapsed, as I predicted. Thom came to see me to vindicate himself, but I only replied with a smile.

All of the students want to have that.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I answered, “Yes, sir.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Mr. Ten was the discipline section chief of the school. He was older than me by a lot, so I respected him as if he were my uncle. Because of a lack of employees, he had to do that job. Usually, Mr. Ten had to check all the records to make sure everything was all right, then hand them to me. I only signed all the records and did not need to know the students’ names; moreover, in many of the lower grades, I did not know any of the students at all. One student record pile was right in front of my seat.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"As I started to sign, Khoan came in and said, “Hiep, you are the principal of the school.

I asked again, “How should I punish him?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Students’ faces became pale with fear. They were afraid of a serious punishment that I would apply. I might take him to the discipline committee and eject him out of the school. If that happened, his education career would be terminated and no one could predict his future.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I turned to Tien and asked, “Why did you do that?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Tien scratched his ear and answered, “I make a joke on you, but I know I went too far.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I was satisfied with his answer. Tien realized his fault, so he did not implore forgiveness.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I thought, ","$":{"class":"indent"},"span":{"_":"Actually, most men have the same problem.

This afternoon, you take a can of paint that has the same color as the chalkboard and fix that.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The entire class burst into laughter. They could not believe that I only punished him that way.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"That news spread all over the school in a few minutes. Students were very happy with my attitude, and from that day on, they loved me more because of my generous action.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I returned to the principal’s office to sign off on those documents.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"It was the first time in my life that I had signed that kind of document. Looking at the record pile, I recognized that it was a ninth grade pile. I wondered to myself why Mr. Ten gave me that class instead of the eleventh grade, which was more important. I sensed something unusual.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I counted the number of records. There were fifty-five records in all. I took out the student list for that class and looked at the number of students. There were fifty-four students in the class. By comparing the student names between the list and the records, I found a fake record. I put that record under the desk cover and started to sign.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When I was finishing that pile, Mr. Ten came in again.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He asked, “Mr. Principal, did you sign these records yet?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“Yes, sir.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He took that pile away and gave me a second one.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I looked carefully at every file to identify if it was a fake one or not before signing.

A few minutes later, Mr. Ten went in and out of the office several times anxiously. Because many teachers came in there to take a drink or return teaching tools, I did not say anything to Mr. Ten.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When every teacher had left the school, I was going to talk with him. Three girl students appeared at the door with ashamed faces, looking at me.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “Tuyet Cowboy, Hue, and Van Phuong, come on in!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Actually, the first girl was named Tuyet, but she rode a male Honda motorcycle like a boy, so I gave her the nickname Tuyet Cowboy. The second girl was Van Phuong, a beautiful girl with a very good voice. She was the best singer at our school and always sang at special ceremonies for the school. Hue was also a nice-looking girl and a close friend of Van Phuong.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Tuyet Cowboy and Van Phuong came into the office.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Phuong prodded Tuyet with her elbow and said, “Tuyet! Say something!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Tuyet laughed. “You asked me to come here with you, but I don’t know anything at all.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I was surprised by their attitude, so I said, “Tuyet and Phuong, what’s going on?

I didn’t know that.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Phuong shyly said, “Teacher, this evening, after school, I will come to your house to take that pantaloon home to mend for you. If you have any bad ones, give them to me. I’ll fix them for you too.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “Thank you in advance, Phuong.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Phuong and Tuyet left the office, and Mr. Ten came in. He went to the ninth grade record and looked it over and over. I realized that no one was at school at that time.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “Mr. Ten! What are you looking for? I see you doing something uneasily.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He replied clumsily, “No, sir! I…I…was just looking for my paper.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “Mr. Ten, please come here. I have something to ask you.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When he stood by my desk, I took the fake record out of the desk cover and said, “Are you looking for this?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I saw his face became pale from fear and break into sweat, “Mr. Principal!

I took pity on him.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I interrupted, “I will not do anything to harm you. You play a dangerous game that could destroy my career. If I sign that record and someday in the future, someone revealed that fact, I would be jailed. Now, if I prosecute you for bribery, you would be jailed.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I saw more teardrops in his eyes. He almost burst into tears.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I continued, “Mr. Ten! I want to show you that it’s very hard to cover something from me. This is the first time I’ve seen you do a bad thing. I will forgive you, but if you do it again, I will take strong measures. I know your family is rich, so why would you do this?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“I’m…I’m…stupid.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“I respect you as I would my uncle, so you must protect my prestige. If you have given me other fake files, take them out, please.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Mr. Ten said happily, “Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Principal.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I tore up the fake file, then went home and left him standing there alone so he could destroy any other fake records.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"That evening, Phuong and Tuyet came to my house and took my two bad pantaloons home.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The next day, Phuong came to my house with two pairs of pants wrapped in newspaper.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"She said, “I return these to you, Teacher.

We all sat on a bamboo bed at the edge of a small irrigation canal in front of Van Phuong’s house.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"It was a moonless night, so it was very dark.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"They asked me about my life for a while, then Phuong asked, “Teacher, do you have any interesting stories that you can narrate to us?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Hue chimed in, “Oh yeah, we love to listen to you narrating the stories.

The story told about a stony statue that could walk at night.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"All of them paid attention in listening to the story.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When I got to the point where the stony statue was slowly walking in a deserted churchyard, I suddenly stopped, pointed to the darkness behind them, and said, “Who is this?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Unexpectedly, all the girls jumped toward me simultaneously, screaming. Because the bed was not sturdy, it broke.

A principal of a big school who had less experience would be assigned as a sub-center chief.

With that function, I was authorized to access any class during the examination time for inspection.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"All of us had to gather at the center one day before the examination for preparation.

Any objection?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“For me, no problem,” I replied. “A countryside view? I like that very much.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"We rode our Honda to that village. It was a pretty prosperous village with a small river in the middle. The main market was on a riverbank, and there was a suspension bridge connecting the market to the other side of the river.
