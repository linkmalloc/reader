Co Chien is a tributary of the Mekong River. So far, I just learned it from geography; now, I can see how big it is. Because of the previous storm, the river was covered with high white waves. In the middle of the river, a ferry moved slowly, lazily, up and down toward us like an old water buffalo dragging a plow when hungry at dusk.

The road was very bad and gave me the feeling of riding on an oxen cart. When we arrived at Phu Phung Village, the night already closed down. The yellow oil lamps of some shops on both sides of the street reminded me that I really bade farewell to the prosperous city and returned to the simple life of the rural country.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"In accordance with Linh’s prediction, one hour later, the bus stopped at the riverbank of a small river, about fifty meters wide. The street was very dark; the light from oil lamps of houses around us could not help us at all. On the other side of the river, I saw several electric lights, a symbol of civilization.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I realized that the road ended at the river and asked Linh, “Can cars go to other side of this river, Linh?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“Yes, Teacher. We don’t have a bridge, but we do have a small ferry to carry cars across. Right here is the ferry landing.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Linh led me as we walked on an earthen road running along the river. The road was wet and slippery because of a thunderstorm that afternoon.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I asked, “Linh! Why do the houses on the other side have electric light?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Linh answered, “That is the district office or District Headquarters, Teacher.

Some dim yellow kerosene lights flickered behind a bamboo hedge on the riverbank and reflected on the river’s surface. Around us, the chirping of crickets mixed with the sound of leaves trembling in the wind; some fireflies flew back and forth. I suddenly gave a sigh; I really missed my family.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Linh asked, “Teacher, how do you feel about the district?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“It seems to be sorrowful.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“I hope you will get used to this.” He smiled then continued, “Tomorrow, many students will come to see you.

Come on in for hot soup! If it is cold, it will not taste good. This time, you cannot eat out because there is no restaurant open.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"With Linh’s natural attitude, I felt good and followed him to the kitchen.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"*****","$":{"class":"xxx"}},{"_":"The next day, I went to Cho Lach High School to show my assigned document to the principal.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The school was a small old complex including three single-story buildings arranged in a U shape with a playground at the middle. The playground was not a place to play because high grasses and weeds grew all over the place, especially at several tiny hills scattered over it. On the playground, I saw a few cows grazing; that gave me the feeling that this was a farm, rather than a school. Scattered on the playground, there were a few small ponds.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Walking through a cement gate, I stepped onto a three-meter-wide brick way that divided the playground into two parts. The way was very old, with broken brick mixed with earth; some places were lower than the playground. Rainwater was caught at those places, so I had to go on tiptoe to prevent my socks from getting wet. That was the main way for the entire school. There were two small cement roads leading to two other buildings. Those small roads’ condition was much better than the main one. In front of the principal’s office, there was a nearly round flower bed with a skewed flagpole.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"At the office, fifty meters away from the gate, I met Nguyen Thanh Thuong, the principal.

But as you know, every year, only a few mathematics teachers graduate from the whole nation, so no one goes to my tiny school. We are at drought, and you are the man to bring rain to us.

One took along a bottle of rice alcohol, another brought a chicken. They held a party to celebrate my first day at school. They were very glad to have a mathematics teacher who graduated from university because there was no mathematics teacher at the school teaching the main subject for their coming baccalaureate examinations.
