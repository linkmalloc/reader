I proposed to organize a fair to raise funds to help them. The money collected would be used to comfort local soldiers and their families to have a good Tet celebration. Some who could make money under the table lived lavishly, but general soldiers still did not have enough money for their families. The school board, on the whole, agreed with my opinion, and in a meeting, they all voted me as the chief of the organization.","$":{"class":"firstpara"},"span":{"_":"B","$":{"class":"_idgendropcap"}}},{"_":"I assigned each class of the senior high school to be in charge of a booth with the help of the conducting teacher. Each class elected a subcommittee to manage their booth, and they needed to know what kind of business that they should operate. I was very busy day and night to prepare the plan and also acted as an advisor for all classes.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"That was also a chance for Cho Lach’s people to enjoy the fair—the first fair ever to take place in the district.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"With the help of all the teachers and support from all the students of the school, I successfully organized the fair in three days and made a big profit.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"On behalf of the fair organization, I took all of the profit to the District Center and donated it to the Tet fund for soldiers of the district.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"One evening after the fair, many students of the eleventh and twelfth grades came to Dong Tien Center to study, even though the holiday was coming soon and the school was already on vacation. They came there to chat with us rather than to learn.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"After chatting for a while, I took my spouse to see the owner of the house where I had once lodged with Duong and Thai in 1968. She was an old lady and very poor. After wishing her a happy new year, we gave her a sum of money, so she could celebrate the Tet.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Returning home, we saw that the light in Dong Tien Center was still on, so we knew those students were still hanging around. Inside the room, the students were arguing and laughing too loud, so they could not hear the sound of my Honda.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Standing outside of the classroom, we heard one guy say, “I think we must have five or six guys use a military poncho to cover those two guys. H must be one of them. Then, we all attack them at the same time.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"H said, “No, you are quicker than me. It is better if you use the poncho to cover them.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"N, the third student, said, “I agree with L. You are stronger than him.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I pushed the door open and asked, “What are you discussing?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"They all said, “Nothing, Teacher, we did not say anything at all!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“Don’t be liars! I heard you talking about beating someone.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"They looked at each other and smiled.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I continued, “If you want to beat someone, you must have a good plan. Can you tell me about it?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"L, a student, said, “We are planning to beat Mr. Long and Mr. Tho.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I asked, “Why do you want to beat them?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"H said, “They always look down on us.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“Only for that reason?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"N said, “They have favor toward schoolgirls and punish us without good reason.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I asked, “So do you have a good plan yet?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"H said, “They’ve told several other male students and me to ambush Mr. Tho and Mr. Long in the schoolyard at night because every night, those two frequently go to the school restroom. When they pass the ambush place, we jump out and use a poncho to cover them, while the rest of us would go out and beat them up.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “It is wrong to want to beat your teacher. This time is not the Confucianism era: first is the king, second is the teacher, and third are the parents. However, beating a teacher is not the right way.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"N asked, “Do you want to vindicate them?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“No, I don’t mean I’m on their side, but you would be in big trouble if you did that. You would only have one good thing but many bad consequences.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"L asked, “Why do you say so?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I explained, “If you carry out that plan, you can get revenge on them. That is a good thing for you. However, are you sure everything would happen as smoothly as you think? They may recognize you before you can cover them. The next day, they would report that to the police, and from that day on, I think you could not attend school for the baccalaureate examination. In addition, they would fight back and hurt you. And you would be committing a sin: ‘Students beat teacher.’”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"They all sat quietly, looking at each other.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Moments later, H asked L, “What do you think?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“I don’t know.

He is right.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"They discarded their plan later.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"*****","$":{"class":"xxx"}},{"_":"I planned to relocate to Vung Tau, where my parents had already built a house on the slope of Little Mountain (Nui Nho) looking out on the Vung Tau Bay.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"To do this, the first thing that we had to do was go to Vung Tau for the Tet celebration with my parents and Thang. Taking advantage of that, I took Diep around to study the locations and teaching conditions of the city, so we might operate a private math center similar to our Dong Tien Center.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"After that, we had to sell my gold that we had saved in the past to have cash to buy a house in that city, next to a private school. The house was big enough to divide into three parts: a living area in the back and upstairs; a center for mathematics, physics, and chemistry; and a front part for a small bookshop for my spouse.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Our dream could not come true when Communists started to attack at Kontum, Pleiku, and Ban Me Thuot Plateau in March of 1975. At the same time, both houses of the US Congress started to discuss the aid to the South Vietnam government. At first, the US government proposed to send $1.4 billion, but both houses cut that down to $900 hundred million. To create pressure on the US for military aid, President Thieu executed a strategy to abandon the plateau while our troops were still fighting.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"That was the most terrible strategy in our history!","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"If we geographically observe South Vietnam, we would realize that in the South Central area, Truong Son Chain and the plateau take a very important position in military strategy because of its perilous terrain with mountains and jungles, which connect to Laos and Cambodia. The rest of South Vietnam is plains and swamps. The shape of Vietnam is long, so we can compare Vietnam to a snake, with Truong Son Chain and the plateau as the backbone. If the backbone is broken, the snake cannot crawl. With that terrain, it is easy to use as a base to attack the enemy and for defensive purposes, but it is very hard to attack. For that reason, from the plateau, we can launch an offense, then withdraw for defense.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The Communists, in particular, had another advantage because the plateau is adjacent to Ho Chi Minh Trail. If they could control the plateau, they could secure the supply source from North Vietnam.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"In conclusion, we can say that whoever could control these terrains would win the war.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"After Communists took control of the plateau, a huge wave of military service people and civilians evacuated from those cities to Qui Nhon and Nha Trang, two cities at the seaside. Thousands of people died on the 19 and 21 inter-nation roads. They were named the Roads of Blood. People had to cross over the corpses of the others to run for their lives. On March 11, the North Vietnamese captured Ban Me Thuot.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When the wave of people overflowed to other cities, it generated chaos. Many military leaders started thinking of deserting. Quite a few military units had no leaders, and the soldiers robbed civilians because of hunger. We could not blame those soldiers and low-ranking officers. They risked their lives in the frontier, and meanwhile, their families lived at home in miserable conditions. On the other hand, many high-ranking officers and a lot of others in the government enjoyed lavish parties with dancing, whiskey, and beautiful girls.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Twenty days after the collapse of Ban Me Thuot, Da Nang also fell into Communist hands. A second gigantic wave of humanity from Hue and Da Nang left their homeland for Nha Trang, then from that city to Vung Tau by sea with ships, ferries, boats, barges, and even with sampans.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"At the Navy Academic Center of Nha Trang, all high-ranking officers brought their families to escape to Vung Tau and Saigon before the Communists’ arrival. Thang Vo, my brother, with a rank of lieutenant, served as an instructor at that center after graduating with a BS degree in the US. Because of a lack of higher-ranking officers, he had to manage orderly withdrawal. He and a thousand other people stood on a ferry towed by a ship for three days. Luckily, his ferry arrived at Vung Tau with very few casualties. But on some other ferries, they did not have that luck; hundreds of people died because of thirst and diseases.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Chaos occurred in Vung Tau during those days. Soldiers without leaders robbed and attacked everywhere in the city.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"On April 1, Cambodian President Lon Nol abdicated.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"At Cho Lach, conditions were no better; the VC attacked and controlled all the surrounding villages—Cai Ga, Tan Thieng. Some artillery units of the 9th Infantry Division had to bombard Tan Thieng day and night. Diep’s brothers’ families had to evacuate to the district capital and live temporarily in my house.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"On April 10, my father suddenly came to see me at Cho Lach.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He told me, “You must arrange everything at your center, then return to Saigon right away. The condition of the South is very dangerous. The owners of the house that you want to buy at Vung Tau have changed their mind. They withdrew the decision to sell their house and returned your money.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “Dad, you return to Saigon first, then I will take Diep there when I complete the arrangement of my properties here.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The next day, I came to see Thai and Hieu, who helped me teach at my Dong Tien Center. I asked them to take a walk with me to a rice field behind Thai’s house. We sat on a dried field divider.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Thai said, “Teacher, perhaps there is a special reason that you call us here.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I told them, “Tomorrow, I will take my wife back to Saigon. I don’t know where I will go in the future. So from now on, I hand my Dong Tien Center over to both of you. Try to manage the center in good condition. I don’t know if I will return here or not. During my absence, all the money that you collect from students, you can divide in two parts for your spending and a small amount to give to Diep’s mom.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Hieu asked me, “Teacher, if you don’t…don’t…”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I understood his meaning. He dared not say the unlucky words that stood for a bad phenomenon.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “If I don’t return here for any reason, this property would belong to both of you. I give it away to you.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The following day, we returned to Saigon. I met Thang there. We all stayed at To’s house. To, my brother-in-law, was a lieutenant colonel at that time. He was commander-in-chief of the 5thSpecial Force Brigade of the police force.","$":{"class":"indent"},"span":{"$":{"class":"superscript"}}},{"_":"His house was at the gate of Cong Hoa Camp, where I had been jailed during President Diem’s era. To and Mai had four children. The eldest son was Le minh Duong; the second, third, and fourth were daughters named Nguyet, Huong, and Xuan respectively. That night, Dad gave me a bag of money that we used to buy the house in Vung Tau. I held that bag, but I did not know how to use it or for what purpose in that circumstance.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"On April 16, the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh, and the VC took control of Long Khanh, a city seventy kilometers northeast of Saigon.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Saigon, at that time, was very tense. Everybody talked of escaping from Vietnam to other countries, as the VC approached closer and closer to Saigon. There was a chaotic atmosphere. People ran back and forth to find the best measure to get out of Vietnam. Thousands of people poured into the US Embassy. Thousands of others crowded the Tan Son Nhat International Airport. The unlucky ones tried to find a way by means of ships or boats. Once in a while, a bomb went off or aircraft bombarded the airfield.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"On the evening of April 21, President Thieu resigned, and Vice President Tran Van Huong replaced him. A few days later, General Duong Van Minh came to power with a unanimous vote of both houses, but there was only one infantry division to protect Saigon and its leader. That was the 18th Infantry Division, under the command of General Le Minh Dao.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Soon, Vung Tau also fell into Communist hands. A lot of officers deserted with their families, especially in the air force and navy, because they had transport facilities. Eventually, Communist troops surrounded Saigon.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"On the evening of April 28, my whole family sat down to discuss our future. My father asked us, “In this situation, what do you think?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"To said, “At the final second, I think I must take my family to get out of this country.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Dad said, “To and Thang should look for a way to get out of this country very soon. Hiep and Diep can leave later. I don’t know your mother’s opinion. As for me, I will stay to wait for your eldest sister, Lan, from Hanoi. For twenty years, I have not seen her.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"My mother said, “So will I. I will stay here too.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Mai said, “I disagree with you. Mom and Dad must go to the US too, especially Dad. If the Communists find out that you escaped from North to South in 1955, they will jail you. Besides, do you think that Lan still recognizes you as her parents?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"To said, “I want to go, but one thing that worries me is what I can do for a living in another country.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Dad said, “That question Thang may answer because he already had experiences a few years ago.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Thang answered, “I had been living in America for a few years. I think we should go to that country. For you.” He referred to To. “You can build a farm to raise chickens as you do now or be a security guard for a living. For Hiep, it is easy. You take some more English classes, then you can teach high school. In America, they still need mathematics teachers.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “In my opinion, To and Thang, you are military personnel. You ought to leave this country because the VC would not forgive you. For me, I will stay in this country. The first reason is that General Minh has just come to power. He wants our nation to become neutralized, so he needs many supporters. I will stay here to support him. The second reason is that my wife is pregnant. She will give birth to a child soon. She also wants to live close to her mom.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Mom said, “If To and Thang decide to leave this country, you should go to Vung Tau. Currently, my friend’s family lives in our house there. The eldest son of that lady is a captain of a ship.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"No one seemed to care for that idea.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I said, “During this time, we have to do something! We cannot look at Communist forces coming into Saigon as a walk in the park.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"To replied, “I have one M18 and two M16s.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Thang clapped his hands. “That’s great!
