His attitude made his friends like me too.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"After dinner, I said, “If you guys have mathematics or physics problems that you cannot solve, take them out here and I will help you.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"They all happily answered, “Yes, Teacher.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"One asked me about an optical problem; others needed to solve electrical ones, and a few others asked me to re-explain space geometry theory. It took me more than two hours to do that job.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"At 9:30 p.m., Be Tu asked me, “Teacher, do you want to play billiards?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I realized that it would be boring if I did not have anything to do, so I replied, “Sure!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“I’ll take you to Lac Hong to play. I think we should take a walk for exercise. But to get there soon, I will lead you to a shortcut. Do you like that, Teacher?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I nodded. “Okay.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He then went ahead; I followed him through dark, remote areas.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Walking through a very dark area, I saw a deserted house. The house looked very good, with brick walls and a tile roof, but it seemed no one took care of the house, so it looked messy. I wondered why no one lived in that house at a time when we did not have enough houses for people.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I asked Be Tu, “Why is that large house vacant?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He suddenly stepped back and held my arm. “Teacher, why…do you…ask…ask that story? It’s horrible!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“What is the horrible story?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“Let’s get out of here, and I’ll tell you.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"A few minutes later, we got to a bright area. I asked, “Now, can you tell me the horrible story of the brick house?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He narrated, “I was told that a few years ago, there was a young couple who lived happily in that brick house. One night, the husband suddenly woke up, took a knife, and stabbed his wife to death. He then embraced his wife’s body and walked in and out the house until the next morning. Finally, the police came, chained him, then put him in jail. Later, there was a story that the house is haunted.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I felt bad for the people in that story; the wife was dead and the husband was jailed. I said, “It’s too pitiful!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Be Tu suddenly put his hand on my mouth and said, “Teacher, don’t say that!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Surprised, I asked, “What’s going on?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“You should not say ‘pitiful.’”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“Why is that important?”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He explained, “In South Vietnam, when something bad happens to a young lady, a man never takes pity on that girl because the girl’s soul would follow the man forever, even taking him to hell to marry.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I laughed. “I don’t believe in ghosts. When I was young, I had to go to school at sunset and return home at midnight. I passed a few cemeteries, but I did not see any ghosts.”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"“I’ve heard it from elderly people, but I don’t know if it’s true or not,” he said.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"We played billiards until after 11:00 in the evening, then returned home. When we approached the brick house, Be Tu held my arm firmly.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I teased him, “It’s too pitiful!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"He shouted, “Teacher, don’t say so!”","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"When we got home, Be Tu told his friends the story. All of them agreed with Be Tu and advised that I should not say so.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I felt tired and looked for a place to sleep. In the house, there was only one blank bed that could sleep two. Usually, that spare bed belonged to two other boys; in our culture, two boys could sleep in one bed and nothing would happen. That night, they yielded the bed for Be Tu and me.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"All the students of that house were preparing for the Baccalaureate-Part I, so they stayed up very late to study. I asked Be Tu to take a piece of material to cover a light that shone directly into my eyes.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Although they read their lessons softly, it was hard to sleep. One student read Vietnamese literature history of the eighteenth century; others read European history.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Unexpectedly, my eyes closed, but I was still aware of my surroundings. I felt as if someone else had closed my eyes rather than doing it myself. I still heard those students reading. I got a bad feeling and tried to open my eyes to see the environment, but I could not.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"Suddenly, I felt someone put a cold hand on my abdomen. At first, I thought Be Tu was trying to tease me. I wanted to tell him to take his hand off my body, but I could not say a word. Just then, my body seemed to be frozen too, and a jittery feeling covered me.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"The cold hand moved slowly to my chest; at that moment, I realized it was a hand of a young lady. My whole body felt numb, and a current of cold ran from my nape through my backbone. The girl’s hand continued to move upward to my neck, then slowly squeezed my throat and made me suffocate. I wanted to call the students to help me, but my mouth was frozen too.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I thought, ","$":{"class":"indent"},"span":{"_":"Is it possible that the story Be Tu told me is real? I took pity on the girl’s family, and she thought I had sympathy for her. She wants me to follow her to hell. But she is only an invisible image, and I am a real person.

Meanwhile, my lungs were out of oxygen. I thought I was going to die.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"_":"I kept on thinking, ","$":{"class":"indent"},"span":{"_":"Can I die this way? My fortitude will prevail over everything, and man must defeat ghost.","$":{"class":"italics1"}}},{"_":"Without a warning, my hand could move. I raised my right hand to hold her cold one turned inside out, while my left hand held her right arm and moved quickly to her elbow. During that movement, I recognized that her arm was as small as a twelve-year-old girl’s, cold as a piece of metal, and soft as rubber. I used an aikido move, and to finish, I used my strength to raise my left arm to push her elbow upward.","$":{"class":"indent"}},{"$":{"class":"images"},"img":{"$":{"class":"_idgenobjectattribute43","src":"image/Image2078_copy.png","alt":"E:\\Book-Cac bai viet\\Book\\Q II\\Days Without the Sun\\THE WEIRD DREAM.png"}}},{"_":"All of sudden, I opened my eyes and realized that my arms and hands were in their right position but holding nothing.
